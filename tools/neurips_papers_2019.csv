Compositional Plan Vectors,"Coline Devin, Daniel Geng, Pieter Abbeel, Trevor Darrell, Sergey Levine","Autonomous agents situated in real-world environments must be able to master large repertoires of skills.
While a single short skill can be learned quickly, it would be impractical to learn every task independently. Instead, the agent should share knowledge across behaviors such that each task can be learned efficiently, and such that the resulting model can generalize to new tasks, especially ones that are compositions or subsets of tasks seen previously.
A policy conditioned on a goal or demonstration has the potential to share knowledge between tasks if it sees enough diversity of inputs. However, these methods may not generalize to a more complex task at test time. We introduce compositional plan vectors (CPVs) to enable a policy to perform compositions of tasks without additional supervision. CPVs represent trajectories as the sum of the subtasks within them. We show that CPVs can be learned within a one-shot imitation learning framework without any additional supervision or information about task hierarchy, and enable a demonstration-conditioned policy to generalize to tasks that sequence twice as many skills as the tasks seen during training.
 Analogously to embeddings such as word2vec in NLP, CPVs can also support simple arithmetic operations -- for example, we can add the CPVs for two different tasks to command an agent to compose both tasks, without any additional training.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/00989c20ff1386dc386d8124ebcba1a5-Paper.pdf,2019,"tasks, cpvs, task, additional, generalize, learned, policy, without, agent, compositions","tasks, task, policy, skills, environment, trajectory, embedding, learning, plan, cpv","{'plan': 0.6297320474262457, 'vectors': 0.5720720112488988, 'compositional': 0.5255198972350983}","{'cpvs': 0.5072101774050238, 'tasks': 0.2769187739807268, 'compositions': 0.17832709424229132, 'additional': 0.17492526900366687, 'generalize': 0.16500133824253227, 'demonstration': 0.15975045848222705, 'task': 0.15865981254723827, 'skills': 0.15486416413268775, 'share': 0.1488838231730338, 'policy': 0.14666030579027442}"
Learning to Propagate for Graph Meta-Learning,"LU LIU, Tianyi Zhou, Guodong Long, Jing Jiang, Chengqi Zhang","Meta-learning extracts the common knowledge from learning different tasks and uses it for unseen tasks. It can signiﬁcantly improve tasks that suffer from insufﬁcient training data, e.g., few-shot learning. In most meta-learning methods, tasks are implicitly related by sharing parameters or optimizer. In this paper, we show that a meta-learner that explicitly relates tasks on a graph describing the relations of their output dimensions (e.g., classes) can signiﬁcantly improve few-shot learning. The graph’s structure is usually free or cheap to obtain but has rarely been explored in previous works. We develop a novel meta-learner of this type for prototype based classiﬁcation, in which a prototype is generated for each class, such that the nearest neighbor search among the prototypes produces an accurate classiﬁcation. The meta-learner, called “Gated Propagation Network (GPN)”, learns to propagate messages between prototypes of different classes on the graph, so that learning the prototype of each class beneﬁts from the data of other related classes. In GPN, an attention mechanism aggregates messages from neighboring classes of each class, with a gate choosing between the aggregated message and the message from the class itself. We train GPN on a sequence of tasks from many-shot to few-shot generated by subgraph sampling. During training, it is able to reuse and update previously achieved prototypes from the memory in a life-long learning cycle. In experiments, under different training-test discrepancy and test task generation settings, GPN outperforms recent meta-learning methods on two benchmark datasets.

XNAS: Neural Architecture Search with Expert Advice,"Niv Nayman, Asaf Noy, Tal Ridnik, Itamar Friedman, Rong Jin, Lihi Zelnik","This paper introduces a novel optimization method for differential neural architecture search, based on the theory of prediction with expert advice. Its optimization criterion is well fitted for an architecture-selection, i.e., it minimizes the regret incurred by a sub-optimal selection of operations. 
Unlike previous search relaxations, that require hard pruning of architectures, our method is designed to dynamically wipe out inferior architectures and enhance superior ones.
It achieves an optimal worst-case regret bound and suggests the use of multiple learning-rates, based on the amount of information carried by the backward gradients. 
Experiments show that our algorithm achieves a strong performance over several image classification datasets.
Specifically, it obtains an error rate of 1.6% for CIFAR-10, 23.9% for ImageNet under mobile settings, and achieves state-of-the-art results on three additional datasets.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/00e26af6ac3b1c1c49d7c3d79c60d000-Paper.pdf,2019,"achieves, architecture, architectures, based, datasets, method, optimal, optimization, regret, search","xnas, search, architecture, experts, nas, regret, weights, network, methods, section","{'advice': 0.49004266197239815, 'expert': 0.49004266197239815, 'xnas': 0.49004266197239815, 'architecture': 0.3640775353260533, 'search': 0.3215620484110276, 'neural': 0.20885393372792393}","{'achieves': 0.23551976403243866, 'selection': 0.1994887743784274, 'architectures': 0.1846624627452563, 'regret': 0.1846624627452563, 'search': 0.18346571265763176, 'wipe': 0.1789178688047496, 'architecture': 0.17484753610757653, 'advice': 0.16253564587323535, 'fitted': 0.16253564587323535, '23': 0.1572617480548729}"
Multi-resolution Multi-task Gaussian Processes,"Oliver Hamelijnck, Theodoros Damoulas, Kangrui Wang, Mark Girolami","We consider evidence integration from potentially dependent observation processes under varying spatio-temporal sampling resolutions and noise levels. We offer a multi-resolution multi-task (MRGP) framework that allows for both inter-task and intra-task multi-resolution and multi-fidelity. We develop shallow Gaussian Process (GP) mixtures that approximate the difficult to estimate joint likelihood with a composite one and deep GP constructions that naturally handle biases.

Deep Equilibrium Models,"Shaojie Bai, J. Zico Kolter, Vladlen Koltun","We present a new approach to modeling sequential data: the deep equilibrium model (DEQ). Motivated by an observation that the hidden layers of many existing deep sequence models converge towards some fixed point, we propose the DEQ approach that directly finds these equilibrium points via root-finding. Such a method is equivalent to running an infinite depth (weight-tied) feedforward network, but has the notable advantage that we can analytically backpropagate through the equilibrium point using implicit differentiation. Using this approach, training and prediction in these networks require only constant memory, regardless of the effective “depth” of the network. We demonstrate how DEQs can be applied to two state-of-the-art deep sequence models: self-attention transformers and trellis networks. On large-scale language modeling tasks, such as the WikiText-103 benchmark, we show that DEQs 1) often improve performance over these state-of-the-art models (for similar parameter counts); 2) have similar computational requirements to existing models; and 3) vastly reduce memory consumption (often the bottleneck for training large sequence models), demonstrating an up-to 88% memory reduction in our experiments.

Cross Attention Network for Few-shot Classification,"Ruibing Hou, Hong Chang, Bingpeng MA, Shiguang Shan, Xilin Chen","Few-shot classification aims to recognize unlabeled samples from unseen classes given only few labeled samples. The unseen classes and low-data problem make few-shot classification very challenging. Many existing approaches extracted features from labeled and unlabeled samples independently, as a result, the features are not discriminative enough. In this work, we propose a novel Cross Attention Network to address the challenging problems in few-shot classification. Firstly, Cross Attention Module is introduced to deal with the problem of unseen classes.  The module generates cross attention maps for each pair of class feature and query sample feature so as to highlight the target object regions, making the extracted feature more discriminative. Secondly, a transductive inference algorithm is proposed to alleviate the low-data problem, which iteratively utilizes the unlabeled query set to augment the support set, thereby making the class features more representative. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks show our method is a simple, effective and computationally efficient framework and outperforms the state-of-the-arts.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/01894d6f048493d2cacde3c579c315a3-Paper.pdf,2019,"attention, classes, classification, cross, feature, features, problem, samples, shot, unlabeled","query, class, shot, feature, attention, set, samples, classiﬁcation, support, features","{'cross': 0.5009339838813426, 'shot': 0.4637558990412013, 'attention': 0.45887431819405367, 'classification': 0.42424580818204094, 'network': 0.37874194940508393}","{'unlabeled': 0.25117154586674734, 'unseen': 0.24807114497561314, 'shot': 0.24236919658767223, 'cross': 0.2384643279544011, 'classes': 0.22237327607626464, 'attention': 0.20584615318291535, 'extracted': 0.2001712338642821, 'feature': 0.18918927988271178, 'features': 0.1840331004074856, 'module': 0.1801292810490662}"
Order Optimal One-Shot Distributed Learning,"Arsalan Sharifnassab, Saber Salehkaleybar, S.

Based on its observed samples, each machine then sends an $O(\log(mn))$-length message to a server, at which a parameter minimizing an expected loss is to be estimated. We propose an algorithm called Multi-Resolution Estimator (MRE) whose expected error is no larger than $\tilde{O}( m^{-1/\max(d,2)} n^{-1/2})$, where $d$ is the dimension of the parameter space. This error bound meets existing lower bounds up to poly-logarithmic factors, and is thereby order optimal. The expected error of MRE, unlike existing algorithms, tends to zero as the number of machines ($m$) goes to infinity, even when the number of samples per machine ($n$) remains upper bounded by a constant. This property of the MRE algorithm makes it applicable in new machine learning paradigms where $m$ is much larger than $n$.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/018b59ce1fd616d874afad0f44ba338d-Paper.pdf,2019,"error, expected, machine, mre, samples, algorithm, existing, larger, machines, number","log, algorithm, error, al, et, expected, mn, mre, machine, server","{'one': 0.4671407902424565, 'order': 0.4614103805364633, 'shot': 0.45101458059716226, 'distributed': 0.4462671172377112, 'optimal': 0.35657111229843247, 'learning': 0.19791031519407204}","{'mre': 0.4589907515429402, 'expected': 0.26382580719830007, 'machines': 0.21949036412020292, 'samples': 0.20450852573288666, 'error': 0.1992709057252753, 'machine': 0.1797728407113652, 'larger': 0.1758838714655334, 'parameter': 0.15688588642681187, 'meets': 0.15299691718098007, 'mn': 0.1448022782694419}"
Exact Gaussian Processes on a Million Data Points,"Ke Wang, Geoff Pleiss, Jacob Gardner, Stephen Tyree, Kilian Q. Weinberger, Andrew Gordon Wilson","Gaussian processes (GPs) are flexible non-parametric models, with a capacity that grows with the available data.
However, computational constraints with standard inference procedures have limited exact GPs to problems with fewer than about ten thousand training points, necessitating approximations for larger datasets. In this paper, we develop a scalable approach for exact GPs that leverages multi-GPU parallelization and methods like linear conjugate gradients, accessing the kernel matrix only through matrix multiplication. By partitioning and distributing kernel matrix multiplies, we demonstrate that an exact GP can be trained on over a million points, a task previously thought to be impossible with current computing hardware. Moreover, our approach is generally applicable, without constraints to grid data or specific kernel classes.

Asymmetric Valleys: Beyond Sharp and Flat Local Minima,"Haowei He, Gao Huang, Yang Yuan","Despite the non-convex nature of their loss functions, deep neural networks are known to generalize well when optimized with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Recent work conjectures that SGD with proper conﬁguration is able to ﬁnd wide and ﬂat local minima, which are correlated with good generalization performance. In this paper, we observe that local minima of modern deep networks are more than being ﬂat or sharp. Instead, at a local minimum there exist many asymmetric directions such that the loss increases abruptly along one side, and slowly along the opposite side – we formally deﬁne such minima as asymmetric valleys. Under mild assumptions, we ﬁrst prove that for asymmetric valleys, a solution biased towards the ﬂat side generalizes better than the exact empirical minimizer. Then, we show that performing weight averaging along the SGD trajectory implicitly induces such biased solutions. This provides theoretical explanations for a series of intriguing phenomena observed in recent work [25, 5, 51]. Finally, extensive empirical experiments on both modern deep networks and simple 2 layer networks are conducted to validate our assumptions and analyze the intriguing properties of asymmetric valleys.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/01d8bae291b1e4724443375634ccfa0e-Paper.pdf,2019,"asymmetric, networks, along, deep, local, minima, sgd, side, valleys, ﬂat","loss, asymmetric, sgd, solution, ﬂat, direction, side, training, figure, generalization","{'sharp': 0.42667132283082027, 'valleys': 0.42667132283082027, 'flat': 0.4038184608978508, 'asymmetric': 0.37502725983442164, 'minima': 0.37502725983442164, 'beyond': 0.3094696462884988, 'local': 0.3094696462884988}","{'asymmetric': 0.364248909612754, 'valleys': 0.31956279176268737, 'ﬂat': 0.31956279176268737, 'minima': 0.23450697709228244, 'side': 0.22030335542512725, 'along': 0.19873969248901188, 'sgd': 0.19526814652815075, 'intriguing': 0.182124454806377, 'biased': 0.1512070484376291, 'local': 0.1507853298058651}"
Calculating Optimistic Likelihoods Using (Geodesically) Convex Optimization,"Viet Anh Nguyen, Soroosh Shafieezadeh Abadeh, Man-Chung Yue, Daniel Kuhn, Wolfram Wiesemann","A fundamental problem arising in many areas of machine learning is the evaluation of the likelihood of a given observation under different nominal distributions. Frequently, these nominal distributions are themselves estimated from data, which makes them susceptible to estimation errors. We thus propose to replace each nominal distribution with an ambiguity set containing all distributions in its vicinity and to evaluate an optimistic likelihood, that is, the maximum of the likelihood over all distributions in the ambiguity set. When the proximity of distributions is quantified by the Fisher-Rao distance or the Kullback-Leibler divergence, the emerging optimistic likelihoods can be computed efficiently using either geodesic or standard convex optimization techniques.

"Think out of the ""Box"": Generically-Constrained Asynchronous Composite Optimization and Hedging","Pooria Joulani, András György, Csaba Szepesvari","We present two new algorithms, ASYNCADA and HEDGEHOG, for asynchronous sparse online and stochastic optimization. ASYNCADA is, to our knowledge, the first asynchronous stochastic optimization algorithm with finite-time data-dependent convergence guarantees for generic convex constraints. In addition, ASYNCADA: (a) allows for proximal (i.e., composite-objective) updates and adaptive step-sizes; (b) enjoys any-time convergence guarantees without requiring an exact global clock; and (c) when the data is sufficiently sparse, its convergence rate for (non-)smooth, (non-)strongly-convex, and even a limited class of non-convex objectives matches the corresponding serial rate, implying a theoretical “linear speed-up”. The second algorithm, HEDGEHOG, is an asynchronous parallel version of the Exponentiated Gradient (EG) algorithm for optimization over the probability simplex (a.k.a. Hedge in online learning), and, to our knowledge, the first asynchronous algorithm enjoying linear speed-ups under sparsity with non-SGD-style updates.

Improved Precision and Recall Metric for Assessing Generative Models,"Tuomas Kynkäänniemi, Tero Karras, Samuli Laine, Jaakko Lehtinen, Timo Aila","The ability to automatically estimate the quality and coverage of the samples produced by a generative model is a vital requirement for driving algorithm research.

By this way, ZS3Net addresses pixel classification tasks where both seen and unseen categories are faced at test time (so called generalized zero-shot classification). Performance is further improved by a self-training step that relies on automatic pseudo-labeling of pixels from unseen classes. On the two standard segmentation datasets, Pascal-VOC and Pascal-Context, we propose zero-shot benchmarks and set competitive baselines.

Hyperspherical Prototype Networks,"Pascal Mettes, Elise van der Pol, Cees Snoek","This paper introduces hyperspherical prototype networks, which unify classification and regression with prototypes on hyperspherical output spaces. For classification, a common approach is to define prototypes as the mean output vector over training examples per class. Here, we propose to use hyperspheres as output spaces, with class prototypes defined a priori with large margin separation. We position prototypes through data-independent optimization, with an extension to incorporate priors from class semantics. By doing so, we do not require any prototype updating, we can handle any training size, and the output dimensionality is no longer constrained to the number of classes. Furthermore, we generalize to regression, by optimizing outputs as an interpolation between two prototypes on the hypersphere. Since both tasks are now defined by the same loss function, they can be jointly trained for multi-task problems. Experimentally, we show the benefit of hyperspherical prototype networks for classification, regression, and their combination over other prototype methods, softmax cross-entropy, and mean squared error approaches.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/02a32ad2669e6fe298e607fe7cc0e1a0-Paper.pdf,2019,"prototypes, output, prototype, class, classification, hyperspherical, regression, defined, mean, networks","prototypes, output, prototype, regression, hyperspherical, classiﬁcation, training, class, networks, classes","{'hyperspherical': 0.693810736937393, 'prototype': 0.6566496714276565, 'networks': 0.295698952186751}","{'prototypes': 0.5110859265280717, 'prototype': 0.39766543513805447, 'hyperspherical': 0.3488797722835817, 'output': 0.23334418667166745, 'regression': 0.1734457515504693, 'class': 0.14780181051032254, 'classification': 0.1425370241016461, 'defined': 0.13431038495087919, 'spaces': 0.1336896763583468, 'mean': 0.12860440572919155}"
Lower Bounds on Adversarial Robustness from Optimal Transport,"Arjun Nitin Bhagoji, Daniel Cullina, Prateek Mittal","While progress has been made in understanding the robustness of machine learning classifiers to test-time adversaries (evasion attacks), fundamental questions remain unresolved. In this paper, we use optimal transport to characterize the maximum achievable accuracy in an adversarial classification scenario. In this setting, an adversary receives a random labeled example from one of two classes, perturbs the example subject to a neighborhood constraint, and presents the modified example to the classifier. We define an appropriate cost function such that the minimum transportation cost between the distributions of the two classes determines the \emph{minimum $0-1$ loss for any classifier}. When the classifier comes from a restricted hypothesis class, the optimal transportation cost provides a lower bound. We apply our framework to the case of Gaussian data with norm-bounded adversaries and explicitly show matching bounds for the classification and transport problems and the optimality of linear classifiers. We also characterize the sample complexity of learning in this setting, deriving and extending previously known results as a special case.

How degenerate is the parametrization of neural networks with the ReLU activation function?,"Dennis Maximilian Elbrächter, Julius Berner, Philipp Grohs","Neural network training is usually accomplished by solving a non-convex optimization problem using stochastic gradient descent. Although one optimizes over the networks parameters, the main loss function generally only depends on the realization of the neural network, i.e. the function it computes. Studying the optimization problem over the space of realizations opens up new ways to understand neural network training. In particular, usual loss functions like mean squared error and categorical cross entropy are convex on spaces of neural network realizations, which themselves are non-convex. Approximation capabilities of neural networks can be used to deal with the latter non-convexity, which allows us to establish that for sufficiently large networks local minima of a regularized optimization problem on the realization space are almost optimal. Note, however, that each realization has many different, possibly degenerate, parametrizations. In particular, a local minimum in the parametrization space needs not correspond to a local minimum in the realization space. To establish such a connection, inverse stability of the realization map is required, meaning that proximity of realizations must imply proximity of corresponding parametrizations. We present pathologies which prevent inverse stability in general, and, for shallow networks, proceed to establish a restricted space of parametrizations on which we have inverse stability w.r.t. to a Sobolev norm. Furthermore, we show that by optimizing over such restricted sets, it is still possible to learn any function which can be learned by optimization over unrestricted sets.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/04115ec378e476c56d19d827bcf8db56-Paper.pdf,2019,"neural, realization, space, network, networks, optimization, convex, establish, function, inverse","inverse, space, stability, parametrization, realization, function, networks, problem, rd, neural","{'parametrization': 0.4802042153931183, 'activation': 0.4544840883379419, 'degenerate': 0.4544840883379419, 'relu': 0.3922665201614822, 'function': 0.3444520322066816, 'networks': 0.20466083294444484, 'neural': 0.20466083294444484}","{'realization': 0.42146632937566214, 'parametrizations': 0.2867962586953291, 'realizations': 0.24281993978602268, 'space': 0.19814505809107047, 'stability': 0.19081097952505752, 'inverse': 0.1896159961433863, 'proximity': 0.16858653175026486, 'establish': 0.166880179849691, 'neural': 0.15308559779979303, 'optimization': 0.14698324577082297}"
Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Neural Networks,"Ines Chami, Zhitao Ying, Christopher Ré, Jure Leskovec","Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) embed nodes in a graph into Euclidean space, which has been shown to incur a large distortion when embedding real-world graphs with scale-free or hierarchical structure. Hyperbolic geometry offers an exciting alternative, as it enables embeddings with much smaller distortion. However, extending GCNs to hyperbolic geometry presents several unique challenges because it is not clear how to define neural network operations, such as feature transformation and aggregation, in hyperbolic space. Furthermore, since input features are often Euclidean, it is unclear how to transform the features into hyperbolic embeddings with the right amount of curvature. Here we propose Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (HGCN), the first inductive hyperbolic GCN that leverages both the expressiveness of GCNs and hyperbolic geometry to learn inductive node representations for hierarchical and scale-free
graphs. We derive GCNs operations in the hyperboloid model of hyperbolic space and map Euclidean input features to embeddings in hyperbolic spaces with different trainable curvature at each layer. Experiments demonstrate that HGCN learns embeddings that preserve hierarchical structure, and leads to improved performance when compared to Euclidean analogs, even with very low dimensional embeddings: compared to state-of-the-art GCNs, HGCN achieves an error reduction of up to 63.1% in ROC AUC for link prediction and of up to 47.5% in F1 score for node classification, also improving state-of-the art on the Pubmed dataset.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/0415740eaa4d9decbc8da001d3fd805f-Paper.pdf,2019,"hyperbolic, embeddings, gcns, euclidean, features, geometry, graph, hgcn, hierarchical, neural","hyperbolic, hgcn, space, euclidean, embeddings, graph, node, networks, features, aggregation","{'hyperbolic': 0.6458489784109421, 'convolutional': 0.49470043942380226, 'graph': 0.39310393190764614, 'networks': 0.30300154375694854, 'neural': 0.30300154375694854}","{'hyperbolic': 0.5803860615224593, 'gcns': 0.34398872325580454, 'embeddings': 0.2472934891756981, 'hgcn': 0.24143050279628528, 'euclidean': 0.21624149754649338, 'geometry': 0.15107282279521786, 'hierarchical': 0.14074650933142288, 'distortion': 0.1267345544688695, 'curvature': 0.12470811412668809, 'inductive': 0.11308775817285997}"

The Internet of Things (IoT) promises to inject machine learning into many of these every-day objects via tiny, cheap MCUs. However, these resource-impoverished hardware platforms severely limit the complexity of machine learning models that can be deployed. For example, although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieve state-of-the-art results on many visual recognition tasks, CNN inference on MCUs is challenging due to severe memory limitations. To circumvent the memory challenge associated with CNNs, various alternatives have been proposed that do fit within the memory budget of an MCU, albeit at the cost of prediction accuracy. This paper challenges the idea that CNNs are not suitable for deployment on MCUs. We demonstrate that it is possible to automatically design CNNs which generalize well, while also being small enough to fit onto memory-limited MCUs.

Uniform convergence may be unable to explain generalization in deep learning,"Vaishnavh Nagarajan, J. Zico Kolter","Aimed at explaining the surprisingly good generalization behavior of overparameterized deep networks, recent works have developed a variety of generalization bounds for deep learning,  all  based on the fundamental learning-theoretic technique of uniform convergence. While
it is well-known that many of these existing bounds are numerically large, through numerous experiments, we bring to light a more concerning aspect of these bounds: 
in practice,  these bounds can {\em increase} with the training dataset size. Guided by our observations,
we then present examples of overparameterized linear classifiers and neural networks trained by  gradient descent (GD) where uniform convergence provably cannot ``explain generalization'' -- even if we take into account the implicit bias of GD {\em to the fullest extent possible}. More precisely, even if we consider only the set of classifiers output by GD, which have test errors less than some small $\epsilon$ in our settings, we show that applying (two-sided) uniform convergence on this set of classifiers will yield only a vacuous generalization guarantee larger than $1-\epsilon$. Through these findings,
we cast doubt on the power of uniform convergence-based generalization bounds to provide a complete picture of why overparameterized deep networks generalize well.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/05e97c207235d63ceb1db43c60db7bbb-Paper.pdf,2019,"bounds, generalization, convergence, uniform, classifiers, deep, gd, networks, overparameterized, based","convergence, uniform, bounds, generalization, error, bound, training, even, set, size","{'explain': 0.4428794376030624, 'may': 0.4428794376030624, 'unable': 0.4428794376030624, 'uniform': 0.4191584559037438, 'convergence': 0.2999944687836914, 'generalization': 0.28848629903845785, 'deep': 0.20790842227390635, 'learning': 0.1394010832218807}","{'gd': 0.32876512055024926, 'overparameterized': 0.30201200018310503, 'uniform': 0.29829879973707, 'generalization': 0.274977066385153, 'bounds': 0.2575872665493479, 'classifiers': 0.21635473714184125, 'convergence': 0.2040200662600559, 'em': 0.15496013723464694, 'epsilon': 0.15004722879400606, 'deep': 0.12448012450259001}"
First order expansion of convex regularized estimators,"Pierre Bellec, Arun Kuchibhotla","We consider first order expansions of convex penalized estimators in
high-dimensional regression problems with random designs. Our setting includes
linear regression and logistic regression as special cases.  For a given
penalty function $h$ and the corresponding penalized estimator $\hbeta$, we
construct a quantity $\eta$, the first order expansion of $\hbeta$, such that
the distance between $\hbeta$ and $\eta$ is an order of magnitude smaller than
the estimation error $\|\hat{\beta} - \beta^*\|$.  In this sense, the first
order expansion $\eta$ can be thought of as a generalization of influence
functions from the mathematical statistics literature to regularized estimators
in high-dimensions.  Such first order expansion implies that the risk of
$\hat{\beta}$ is asymptotically the same as the risk of $\eta$ which leads to a
precise characterization of the MSE of $\hbeta$; this characterization takes a
particularly simple form for isotropic design.  Such first order expansion also
leads to inference results based on $\hat{\beta}$.  We provide sufficient
conditions for the existence of such first order expansion for three
regularizers: the Lasso in its constrained form, the lasso in its penalized
form, and the Group-Lasso.  The results apply to general loss functions under
some conditions and those conditions are satisfied for the squared loss in

The method balances exploitation and exploration, exciting the system in such a way so as to reduce uncertainty in the model parameters to which the worst-case cost is most sensitive.

Modeling Uncertainty by Learning a Hierarchy of Deep Neural Connections,"Raanan Yehezkel Rohekar, Yaniv Gurwicz, Shami Nisimov, Gal Novik","Modeling uncertainty in deep neural networks, despite recent important advances, is still an open problem. Bayesian neural networks are a powerful solution, where the prior over network weights is a design choice, often a normal distribution or other distribution encouraging sparsity. However, this prior is agnostic to the generative process of the input data, which might lead to unwarranted generalization for out-of-distribution tested data. We suggest the presence of a confounder for the relation between the input data and the discriminative function given the target label.
We propose an approach for modeling this confounder by sharing neural connectivity patterns between the generative and discriminative networks. This approach leads to a new deep architecture, where networks are sampled from the posterior of local causal structures, and coupled into a compact hierarchy. We demonstrate that sampling networks from this hierarchy, proportionally to their posterior, is efficient and enables estimating various types of uncertainties.

Meta-Surrogate Benchmarking for Hyperparameter Optimization,"Aaron Klein, Zhenwen Dai, Frank Hutter, Neil Lawrence, Javier Gonzalez","Despite the recent progress in hyperparameter optimization (HPO), available benchmarks that resemble real-world scenarios consist of a few and very large problem instances that are expensive to solve. This blocks researchers and practitioners no only from systematically running large-scale comparisons that are needed to draw statistically significant results but also from reproducing experiments that were conducted before.
This work proposes a method to alleviate these issues by means of a meta-surrogate model for HPO tasks trained on off-line generated data. The model combines a probabilistic encoder with a multi-task model such that it can generate inexpensive and realistic tasks of the class of problems of interest.

However, for the common squared exponential (SE) and Mat\'{e}rn kernels, this is seen to be significantly larger than a fundamental $\Omega(T^{\frac{1}{1+\alpha}})$ lower bound on regret.

Distribution Learning of a Random Spatial Field with a Location-Unaware Mobile Sensor,"Meera Pai, Animesh Kumar","Measurement of spatial fields is of interest in environment monitoring. Recently mobile sensing has been proposed for spatial field reconstruction, which requires a smaller number of sensors when compared to the traditional paradigm of sensing with static sensors.

While GPS or other localization methods can reduce this uncertainty, we address a more fundamental question: can a location-unaware mobile sensor, recording samples on a directed non-uniform random walk, learn the statistical distribution (as a function of space) of an underlying random process (spatial field)? The answer is in the affirmative for Lipschitz continuous fields, where the accuracy of our distribution-learning method increases with the number of observed field samples (sampling rate).

State Aggregation Learning from Markov Transition Data,"Yaqi Duan, Tracy Ke, Mengdi Wang","State aggregation is a popular model reduction method rooted in optimal control. It reduces the complexity of engineering systems by mapping the system’s states into a small number of meta-states. The choice of aggregation map often depends on the data analysts’ knowledge and is largely ad hoc. In this paper, we propose a tractable algorithm that estimates the probabilistic aggregation map from the system’s trajectory. We adopt a soft-aggregation model, where each meta-state has a signature raw state, called an anchor state. This model includes several common state aggregation models as special cases. Our proposed method is a simple two- step algorithm: The first step is spectral decomposition of empirical transition matrix, and the second step conducts a linear transformation of singular vectors to find their approximate convex hull. It outputs the aggregation distributions and disaggregation distributions for each meta-state in explicit forms, which are not obtainable by classical spectral methods. On the theoretical side, we prove sharp error bounds for estimating the aggregation and disaggregation distributions and for identifying anchor states. The analysis relies on a new entry-wise deviation bound for singular vectors of the empirical transition matrix of a Markov process, which is of independent interest and cannot be deduced from existing literature.

Meta-Learning with Implicit Gradients,"Aravind Rajeswaran, Chelsea Finn, Sham M. Kakade, Sergey Levine","A core capability of intelligent systems is the ability to quickly learn new tasks by drawing on prior experience. Gradient (or optimization) based meta-learning has recently emerged as an effective approach for few-shot learning. In this formulation, meta-parameters are learned in the outer loop, while task-specific models are learned in the inner-loop, by using only a small amount of data from the current task. A key challenge in scaling these approaches is the need to differentiate through the inner loop learning process, which can impose considerable computational and memory burdens. By drawing upon implicit differentiation, we develop the implicit MAML algorithm, which depends only on the solution to the inner level optimization and not the path taken by the inner loop optimizer. This effectively decouples the meta-gradient computation from the choice of inner loop optimizer. As a result, our approach is agnostic to the choice of inner loop optimizer and can gracefully handle many gradient steps without vanishing gradients or memory constraints. Theoretically, we prove that implicit MAML can compute accurate meta-gradients with a memory footprint that is, up to small constant factors, no more than that which is required to compute a single inner loop gradient and at no overall increase in the total computational cost. Experimentally, we show that these benefits of implicit MAML translate into empirical gains on few-shot image recognition benchmarks.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/072b030ba126b2f4b2374f342be9ed44-Paper.pdf,2019,"inner, loop, gradient, implicit, meta, learning, maml, memory, optimizer, approach","meta, gradient, optimization, inner, maml, learning, algorithm, imaml, alg, memory","{'gradients': 0.6176917189439423, 'implicit': 0.5549017139143622, 'meta': 0.5038767351700696, 'learning': 0.2380110585610103}","{'loop': 0.46569577284225055, 'inner': 0.4511203376251159, 'maml': 0.2352362369820901, 'optimizer': 0.22477923093556235, 'implicit': 0.22293036234558009, 'meta': 0.21933867746324756, 'drawing': 0.15308865794503906, 'memory': 0.1469895910705309, 'gradient': 0.13347132538911, 'choice': 0.11274088536637486}"

Universal Boosting Variational Inference,"Trevor Campbell, Xinglong Li","Boosting variational inference (BVI) approximates an intractable probability density by iteratively building up a mixture of simple component distributions one at a time, using techniques from sparse convex optimization to provide both computational scalability and approximation error guarantees. But the guarantees have strong conditions that do not often hold in practice, resulting in degenerate component optimization problems; and we show that the ad-hoc regularization used to prevent degeneracy in practice can cause BVI to fail in unintuitive ways.  We thus develop universal boosting variational inference (UBVI), a BVI scheme that exploits the simple geometry of probability densities under the Hellinger metric to prevent the degeneracy of other gradient-based BVI methods, avoid difficult joint optimizations of both component and weight, and simplify fully-corrective weight optimizations.  We show that for any target density and any mixture component family, the output of UBVI converges to the best possible approximation in the mixture family, even when the mixture family is misspecified.  We develop a scalable implementation based on exponential family mixture components and standard stochastic optimization techniques.  Finally, we discuss statistical benefits of the Hellinger distance as a variational objective through bounds on posterior probability, moment, and importance sampling errors.

LIIR: Learning Individual Intrinsic Reward in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,"Yali Du, Lei Han, Meng Fang, Ji Liu, Tianhong Dai, Dacheng Tao","A great challenge in cooperative decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is generating diversified behaviors for each individual agent when receiving only a team reward. Prior studies have paid much effort on reward shaping or designing a centralized critic that can discriminatively credit the agents.
In this paper, we propose to merge the two directions and learn each agent an intrinsic reward function which diversely stimulates the agents at each time step. Specifically, the intrinsic reward for a specific agent will be involved in computing a distinct proxy critic for the agent to direct the updating of its individual policy. Meanwhile, the parameterized intrinsic reward function will be updated towards maximizing the expected accumulated team reward from the environment so that the objective is consistent with the original MARL problem. The proposed method is referred to as learning individual intrinsic reward (LIIR) in MARL. We compare LIIR with a number of state-of-the-art MARL methods on battle games in StarCraft II.

A Normative Theory for Causal Inference and Bayes Factor Computation in Neural Circuits,"Wenhao Zhang, Si Wu, Brent Doiron, Tai Sing Lee","This study provides a normative theory for how Bayesian causal inference can be implemented in neural circuits. In both cognitive processes such as causal reasoning and perceptual inference such as cue integration, the nervous systems need to choose different models representing the underlying causal structures when making inferences on external stimuli. In multisensory processing, for example, the nervous system has to choose whether to integrate or segregate inputs from different sensory modalities to infer the sensory stimuli, based on whether the inputs are from the same or different sources. Making this choice is a model selection problem requiring the computation of Bayes factor, the ratio of likelihoods between the integration and the segregation models. In this paper, we consider the causal inference in multisensory processing and propose a novel generative model based on neural population code that takes into account both stimulus feature and stimulus reliability in the inference. In the case of circular variables such as heading direction, our normative theory yields an analytical solution for computing the Bayes factor, with a clear geometric interpretation, which can be implemented by simple additive mechanisms with neural population code. Numerical simulation shows that the tunings of the neurons computing Bayes factor are consistent with the ""opposite neurons"" discovered in dorsal medial superior temporal (MSTd) and the ventral intraparietal (VIP) areas for visual-vestibular processing.

We demonstrate that each MASO layer's input space partitioning corresponds to a power diagram (an extension of the classical Voronoi tiling) with a number of regions that grows exponentially with respect to the number of units (neurons).
We further show that a composition of MASO layers (e.g., the entire DN) produces a progressively subdivided power diagram and provide its analytical form. 
The subdivision process constrains the affine maps on the potentially exponentially many power diagram regions with respect to the number of neurons to greatly reduce their complexity. 
For classification problems, we obtain a formula for a MASO DN's decision boundary in the input space plus a measure of its curvature that depends on the DN's nonlinearities, weights, and architecture.

Visual Sequence Learning  in Hierarchical Prediction Networks and Primate Visual Cortex,,"In this paper we developed a computational hierarchical network model to understand the spatiotemporal  sequence learning effects observed in the primate  visual cortex.

  The model performs fast feedforward analysis using a deep convolutional neural network with sparse convolution and feedback synthesis using a stack of LSTM modules. The network learns a representational hierarchy by minimizing its prediction errors of the incoming signals at each level of the hierarchy. We found that recurrent feedback in this network lead to the development of  semantic cluster of global movement patterns in the population codes of the units at the lower levels of the hierarchy.  These representations facilitate the learning of relationship among movement patterns, yielding state-of-the-art performance in long range video sequence predictions on benchmark datasets.

Coda: An End-to-End Neural Program Decompiler,"Cheng Fu, Huili Chen, Haolan Liu, Xinyun Chen, Yuandong Tian, Farinaz Koushanfar, Jishen Zhao","Reverse engineering of binary executables is a critical problem in the computer security domain. On the one hand, malicious parties may recover interpretable source codes from the software products to gain commercial advantages. On the other hand, binary decompilation can be leveraged for code vulnerability analysis and malware detection. However, efficient binary decompilation is challenging. Conventional decompilers have the following major limitations: (i) they are only applicable to specific source-target language pair, hence incurs undesired development cost for new language tasks; (ii) their output high-level code cannot effectively preserve the correct functionality of the input binary; (iii) their output program does not capture the semantics of the input and the reversed program is hard to interpret. To address the above problems, we propose Coda1, the first end-to-end neural-based framework for code decompilation. Coda decomposes the decompilation task into of two key phases: First, Coda employs an instruction type-aware encoder and a tree decoder for generating an abstract syntax tree (AST) with attention feeding during the code sketch generation stage. Second, Coda then updates the code sketch using an iterative error correction machine guided by an ensembled neural error predictor. By finding a good approximate candidate and then fixing it towards perfect, Coda achieves superior with performance compared to baseline approaches. We assess Coda’s performance with extensive experiments on various benchmarks. Evaluation results show that Coda achieves an average of 82% program recovery accuracy on unseen binary samples, where the state-of-the-art decompilers yield 0% accuracy. Furthermore, Coda outperforms the sequence-to-sequence model with attention by a margin of 70% program accuracy.

In many cases, increasing model capacity beyond the memory limit of a single accelerator has required developing special algorithms or infrastructure. These solutions are often architecture-specific and do not transfer to other machine learning tasks. To address the need for efficient and task-independent model parallelism, we introduce TensorPipe, a pipeline parallelism library that allows scaling any network that can be expressed as a sequence of layers.  By pipelining different sub-sequences of layers on separate accelerators, TensorPipe provides the flexibility of scaling a variety of different networks to gigantic sizes efficiently. Moreover, TensorPipe utilizes a novel batch-splitting pipelining algorithm,  resulting in almost linear speedup when a model is partitioned across multiple accelerators.

store, and search a billion point database on a single workstation with just 64GB

we demonstrate that the SSD-based indices built by DiskANN can meet all three
desiderata for large-scale ANNS: high-recall, low query latency and high density
(points indexed per node). On the billion point SIFT1B bigann dataset, DiskANN

Linear Stochastic Bandits Under Safety Constraints,"Sanae Amani, Mahnoosh Alizadeh, Christos Thrampoulidis","Bandit algorithms have various application in safety-critical systems, where it is important to respect the system constraints that rely on the bandit's unknown parameters at every round. In this paper, we formulate a linear stochastic multi-armed bandit problem with safety constraints that depend (linearly) on an unknown parameter vector. As such, the learner is unable to identify all safe actions and must act conservatively in ensuring that her actions satisfy the safety constraint at all rounds (at least with high probability). For these bandits, we propose a new UCB-based algorithm called Safe-LUCB, which includes necessary modifications to respect safety constraints. The algorithm has two phases. During the pure exploration phase the learner chooses her actions at random from a restricted set of safe actions with the goal of learning a good approximation of the entire unknown safe set. Once this goal is achieved, the algorithm begins a safe exploration-exploitation phase where the learner gradually expands their estimate of the set of safe actions while controlling the growth of regret. We provide a general regret bound for the algorithm, as well as a problem dependent bound that is connected to the location of the optimal action within the safe set. We then propose a modified heuristic that exploits our problem dependent analysis to improve the regret.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/09a8a8976abcdfdee15128b4cc02f33a-Paper.pdf,2019,"safe, actions, algorithm, safety, set, bandit, constraints, learner, problem, regret","safe, regret, lucb, safety, algorithm, set, ds, exploration, actions, xt","{'safety': 0.6021983825531849, 'constraints': 0.4741696440433748, 'bandits': 0.39226472922280564, 'linear': 0.36797200748807796, 'stochastic': 0.351063015185394}","{'safe': 0.5485280699265174, 'actions': 0.3040547943577609, 'safety': 0.28253596197177594, 'learner': 0.18567623262125735, 'bandit': 0.17404974951895302, 'constraints': 0.1550961176218902, 'regret': 0.1540716806315353, 'set': 0.15211163426995852, 'unknown': 0.14976501271114326, 'phase': 0.13482312218639605}"
Power analysis of knockoff filters for correlated designs,"Jingbo Liu, Philippe Rigollet","The knockoff filter introduced by Barber and Cand\`es 2016 is an elegant framework for controlling the false discovery rate in variable selection. 
While empirical results indicate that this methodology  is not too conservative,
there is no conclusive theoretical result on its power. When the predictors are i.i.d.\ Gaussian, it is known that as the signal to noise ratio tend to infinity, the knockoff filter is consistent in the sense that one can make FDR go to 0 and power go to 1 simultaneously. In this work we study the case where the predictors have a general covariance matrix $\bsigma$. We introduce a simple functional called \emph{effective signal deficiency (ESD)} of the covariance matrix of the predictors
that predicts consistency of various variable selection methods. 
In particular,
ESD reveals that the structure of the precision matrix 
plays a central role in consistency and therefore, so does the conditional independence structure of the predictors. To leverage this connection, we introduce \emph{Conditional Independence knockoff}, a simple procedure that is able to compete with the more sophisticated knockoff filters and that is defined when the predictors obey a Gaussian tree graphical models (or when the graph is sufficiently sparse).

Implicitly learning to reason in first-order logic,"Vaishak Belle, Brendan Juba","We consider the problem of answering queries about formulas of first-order logic based on background knowledge partially represented explicitly as other formulas, and partially represented as examples independently drawn from a fixed probability distribution. PAC semantics, introduced by Valiant, is one rigorous, general proposal for learning to reason in formal languages: although weaker than classical entailment, it allows for a powerful model theoretic framework for answering queries while requiring minimal assumptions about the form of the distribution in question. To date, however, the most significant limitation of that approach, and more generally most machine learning approaches with robustness guarantees, is that the logical language is ultimately essentially propositional, with finitely many atoms. Indeed, the theoretical findings on the learning of relational theories in such generality have been resoundingly negative. This is despite the fact that first-order logic is widely argued to be most appropriate for representing human knowledge. 
In this work, we present a new theoretical approach to robustly learning to reason in first-order logic, and consider universally quantified clauses over a countably infinite domain.

Beyond the Single Neuron Convex Barrier for Neural Network Certification,"Gagandeep Singh, Rupanshu Ganvir, Markus Püschel, Martin Vechev","We propose a new parametric framework, called k-ReLU, for computing precise

approximate the output of multiple ReLUs in a layer jointly instead of separately.
This joint relaxation captures dependencies between the inputs to different ReLUs
in a layer and thus overcomes the convex barrier imposed by the single neuron
triangle relaxation and its approximations. The framework is parametric in the
number of k ReLUs it considers jointly and can be combined with existing verifiers

Variational Mixture-of-Experts Autoencoders for Multi-Modal Deep Generative Models,"Yuge Shi, Siddharth N, Brooks Paige, Philip Torr","Learning generative models that span multiple data modalities, such as vision and language, is often motivated by the desire to learn more useful, generalisable representations that faithfully capture common underlying factors between the modalities.

Language as an Abstraction for Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning,"YiDing Jiang, Shixiang (Shane) Gu, Kevin P. Murphy, Chelsea Finn","Solving complex, temporally-extended tasks is a long-standing problem in reinforcement learning (RL). We hypothesize that one critical element of solving such problems is the notion of compositionality. With the ability to learn sub-skills that can be composed to solve longer tasks, i.e. hierarchical RL, we can acquire temporally-extended behaviors. However, acquiring effective yet general abstractions for hierarchical RL is remarkably challenging. In this paper, we propose to use language as the abstraction, as it provides unique compositional structure, enabling fast learning and combinatorial generalization, while retaining tremendous flexibility, making it suitable for a variety of problems. Our approach learns an instruction-following low-level policy and a high-level policy that can reuse abstractions across tasks, in essence, permitting agents to reason using structured language. To study compositional task learning, we introduce an open-source object interaction environment built using the MuJoCo physics engine and the CLEVR engine. We find that, using our approach, agents can learn to solve to diverse, temporally-extended tasks such as object sorting and multi-object rearrangement, including from raw pixel observations. Our analysis find that the compositional nature of language is critical for learning and systematically generalizing sub-skills in comparison to non-compositional abstractions that use the same supervision.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/0af787945872196b42c9f73ead2565c8-Paper.pdf,2019,"compositional, learning, tasks, abstractions, extended, language, object, rl, temporally, using","level, policy, language, low, learning, st, high, goal, instructions, state","{'abstraction': 0.5652417350114941, 'hierarchical': 0.4664331864268632, 'language': 0.4564276302229833, 'reinforcement': 0.3500066144836051, 'deep': 0.3018918607216431, 'learning': 0.2024162943482062}","{'compositional': 0.3410096869138752, 'abstractions': 0.3020766204536631, 'temporally': 0.2513150873522073, 'engine': 0.20138441363577542, 'extended': 0.19393401021817971, 'rl': 0.1908094925645862, 'object': 0.17793408486719361, 'language': 0.16692929980159116, 'skills': 0.16241873442912205, 'tasks': 0.14521370086328553}"
High-dimensional multivariate forecasting with low-rank Gaussian Copula Processes,"David Salinas, Michael Bohlke-Schneider, Laurent Callot, Roberto Medico, Jan Gasthaus","Predicting the dependencies between observations from multiple time series is critical for applications such as anomaly detection, financial risk management, causal analysis, or demand forecasting.

We propose to combine an RNN-based time series model with a Gaussian copula process output model with a low-rank covariance structure to reduce the computational complexity and handle non-Gaussian marginal distributions.
This permits to drastically reduce the number of parameters and consequently allows the modeling of time-varying correlations of thousands of time series.

A data-driven approach, however, could overcome limitations in such rule-based approaches and improve precision mappings for individuals. In this work, we explore a framework that facilitates applying learning algorithms to automatically extract brain connectomes. Using a tensor encoding, we design an objective with a group-regularizer that prefers biologically plausible fascicle structure. We show that the objective is convex and has unique solutions, ensuring identifiable connectomes for an individual. We develop an efficient optimization strategy for this extremely high-dimensional sparse problem, by reducing the number of parameters using a greedy algorithm designed specifically for the problem.

Optimal Sketching for Kronecker Product Regression and Low Rank Approximation,"Huaian Diao, Rajesh Jayaram, Zhao Song, Wen Sun, David Woodruff","We study the Kronecker product regression problem, in which the design matrix is a Kronecker product of two or more matrices. Formally, given $A_i \in \R^{n_i \times d_i}$ for $i=1,2,\dots,q$  where $n_i \gg d_i$ for each $i$, and $b \in \R^{n_1 n_2 \cdots n_q}$, let $\mathcal{A} = A_i \otimes A_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes A_q$. Then for $p \in [1,2]$, the goal is to find $x \in \R^{d_1 \cdots d_q}$ that approximately minimizes $\|\mathcal{A}x - b\|_p$. Recently, Diao, Song, Sun, and Woodruff (AISTATS, 2018) gave an algorithm which is faster than forming the Kronecker product $\mathcal{A} \in \R^{n_1 \cdots n_q \times d_1 \cdots d_q}$. Specifically, for $p=2$ they achieve a running time of $O(\sum_{i=1}^q   \texttt{nnz}(A_i) + \texttt{nnz}(b))$, where $ \texttt{nnz}(A_i)$ is the number of non-zero entries in $A_i$. Note that $\texttt{nnz}(b)$ can be as large as $\Theta(n_1 \cdots n_q)$. For $p=1,$ $q=2$ and $n_1 = n_2$, they achieve a worse bound of $O(n_1^{3/2} \text{poly}(d_1d_2) + \texttt{nnz}(b))$. In this work, we provide significantly faster algorithms. For $p=2$, our running time is $O(\sum_{i=1}^q   \texttt{nnz}(A_i) )$, which has no dependence on $\texttt{nnz}(b)$.  For $p<2$, our running time is $O(\sum_{i=1}^q   \texttt{nnz}(A_i) + \texttt{nnz}(b))$, which matches the prior best running time for $p=2$.  We also consider the related all-pairs regression problem, where given $A \in \R^{n \times d}, b \in \R^n$,  we want to solve $\min_{x \in \R^d} \|\bar{A}x - \bar{b}\|_p$, where $\bar{A} \in \R^{n^2 \times d}, \bar{b} \in \R^{n^2}$ consist of all pairwise differences of the rows of $A,b$. We give an $O(\texttt{nnz}(A))$ time algorithm for $p \in[1,2]$, improving the $\Omega(n^2)$ time required to form $\bar{A}$. Finally, we initiate the study of Kronecker product low rank and and low-trank approximation. For input $\mathcal{A}$ as above, we give $O(\sum_{i=1}^q  \texttt{nnz}(A_i))$ time algorithms, which is much faster than computing $\mathcal{A}$.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/0c215f194276000be6a6df6528067151-Paper.pdf,2019,"nnz, texttt, a_i, time, cdots, bar, mathcal, n_1, kronecker, product","regression, algorithm, nnz, matrix, time, ai, rn, a1, kronecker, product","{'kronecker': 0.46591179104995994, 'product': 0.39829698475589675, 'sketching': 0.38880968112373526, 'rank': 0.3419032769995175, 'approximation': 0.32119487482967213, 'low': 0.3080503182194514, 'regression': 0.2972250130007264, 'optimal': 0.26421779162500386}","{'nnz': 0.44547182219972314, 'texttt': 0.44547182219972314, 'a_i': 0.36859391209584397, 'cdots': 0.25113331315506715, 'bar': 0.2303711950599025, 'n_1': 0.2303711950599025, 'kronecker': 0.1744258616812174, 'sum_': 0.15379829849677243, 'mathcal': 0.15116772299006723, 'n_q': 0.1382227170359415}"

Minimizing this loss function corresponds naturally to maximizing the return of a horse race, where a player aims to balance between betting on an outcome (making a prediction) when confident and reserving one's winnings (abstaining) when not confident. This loss function allows us to train neural networks and characterize the disconfidence of prediction in an end-to-end fashion.

Localized Structured Prediction,"Carlo Ciliberto, Francis Bach, Alessandro Rudi","Key to structured prediction is exploiting the problem's structure to simplify the learning process. A major challenge arises when data exhibit a local structure (i.e., are made ``by parts'') that can be leveraged to better approximate the relation between (parts of) the input and (parts of) the output. Recent literature on signal processing, and in particular computer vision, shows that capturing these aspects is indeed essential to achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, in this context algorithms are typically derived on a case-by-case basis. In this work we propose the first theoretical framework to deal with part-based data from a general perspective and study a novel method within the setting of statistical learning theory.

Fast Low-rank Metric Learning for Large-scale and High-dimensional Data,"Han Liu, Zhizhong Han, Yu-Shen Liu, Ming Gu","Low-rank metric learning aims to learn better discrimination of data subject to low-rank constraints. It keeps the intrinsic low-rank structure of datasets and reduces the time cost and memory usage in metric learning. However, it is still a challenge for current methods to handle datasets with both high dimensions and large numbers of samples. To address this issue, we present a novel fast low-rank metric learning (FLRML) method. FLRML casts the low-rank metric learning problem into an unconstrained optimization on the Stiefel manifold, which can be efficiently solved by searching along the descent curves of the manifold. FLRML significantly reduces the complexity and memory usage in optimization, which makes the method scalable to both high dimensions and large numbers of samples.

Wide Neural Networks of Any Depth Evolve as Linear Models Under Gradient Descent,"Jaehoon Lee, Lechao Xiao, Samuel Schoenholz, Yasaman Bahri, Roman Novak, Jascha Sohl-Dickstein, Jeffrey Pennington","A longstanding goal in deep learning research has been to precisely characterize training and generalization. However, the often complex loss landscapes of neural networks have made a theory of learning dynamics elusive. In this work, we show that for wide neural networks the learning dynamics simplify considerably and that, in the infinite width limit, they are governed by a linear model obtained from the first-order Taylor expansion of the network around its initial parameters. Furthermore, mirroring the correspondence between wide Bayesian neural networks and Gaussian processes, gradient-based training of wide neural networks with a squared loss produces test set predictions drawn from a Gaussian process with a particular compositional kernel. While these theoretical results are only exact in the infinite width limit, we nevertheless find excellent empirical agreement between the predictions of the original network and those of the linearized version even for finite practically-sized networks.

Retrosynthesis Prediction with Conditional Graph Logic Network,"Hanjun Dai, Chengtao Li, Connor Coley, Bo Dai, Le Song","Retrosynthesis is one of the fundamental problems in organic chemistry. The task is to identify reactants that can be used to synthesize a specified product molecule. Recently, computer-aided retrosynthesis is finding renewed interest from both chemistry and computer science communities. Most existing approaches rely on template-based models that define subgraph matching rules, but whether or not a chemical reaction can proceed is not defined by hard decision rules. In this work, we propose a new approach to this task using the Conditional Graph Logic Network, a conditional graphical model built upon graph neural networks that learns when rules from reaction templates should be applied, implicitly considering whether the resulting reaction would be both chemically feasible and strategic. We also propose an efficient hierarchical sampling to alleviate the computation cost.

Unsupervised Emergence of Egocentric Spatial Structure from Sensorimotor Prediction,"Alban Laflaquière, Michael Garcia Ortiz","Despite its omnipresence in robotics application, the nature of spatial knowledge and the mechanisms that underlie its emergence in autonomous agents are still poorly understood. Recent theoretical works suggest that the Euclidean structure of space induces invariants in an agent’s raw sensorimotor experience. We hypothesize that capturing these invariants is beneficial for sensorimotor prediction and that, under certain exploratory conditions, a motor representation capturing the structure of the external space should emerge as a byproduct of learning to predict future sensory experiences. We propose a simple sensorimotor predictive scheme, apply it to different agents and types of exploration, and evaluate the pertinence of these hypotheses.

Adversarial Robustness through Local Linearization,"Chongli Qin, James Martens, Sven Gowal, Dilip Krishnan, Krishnamurthy Dvijotham, Alhussein Fawzi, Soham De, Robert Stanforth, Pushmeet Kohli","Adversarial training is an effective methodology for training deep neural networks that are robust against adversarial, norm-bounded perturbations. However, the computational cost of adversarial training grows prohibitively as the size of the model and number of input dimensions increase. Further, training against less expensive and therefore weaker adversaries produces models that are robust against weak attacks but break down under attacks that are stronger. This is often attributed to the phenomenon of gradient obfuscation; such models have a highly non-linear loss surface in the vicinity of training examples, making it hard for gradient-based attacks to succeed even though adversarial examples still exist. In this work, we introduce a novel regularizer that encourages the loss to behave linearly in the vicinity of the training data, thereby penalizing gradient obfuscation while encouraging robustness. We show via extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, that models trained with our regularizer avoid gradient obfuscation and can be trained significantly faster than adversarial training. Using this regularizer, we exceed current state of the art and achieve 47% adversarial accuracy for ImageNet with L-infinity norm adversarial perturbations of radius 4/255 under an untargeted, strong, white-box attack.

Because we are no longer averaging over coarse groups (such as race or gender), this is a semantically meaningful individual-level constraint. Given a sample of individuals and problems, we design an oracle-efficient algorithm (i.e. one that is given access to any standard, fairness-free learning heuristic) for the fair empirical risk minimization task.

Comparing distributions: $\ell_1$ geometry improves kernel two-sample testing,"meyer scetbon, Gael Varoquaux","Are two sets of observations drawn from the same distribution? This
problem is a two-sample test. 
Kernel methods lead to many appealing properties. Indeed state-of-the-art
approaches use the $L^2$ distance between kernel-based
distribution representatives to derive their test statistics. Here, we show that
$L^p$ distances (with $p\geq 1$) between these
distribution representatives give metrics on the space of distributions that are
well-behaved to detect differences between distributions as they
metrize the weak convergence. Moreover, for analytic kernels,
we show that the $L^1$ geometry gives improved testing power for
scalable computational procedures. Specifically, we derive a finite
dimensional approximation of the metric given as the $\ell_1$ norm of a vector which captures differences of expectations of analytic functions evaluated at spatial locations or frequencies (i.e, features). The features can be chosen to
maximize the differences of the distributions and give interpretable
indications of how they differs. Using an $\ell_1$ norm gives better detection
because differences between representatives are dense
as we use analytic kernels (non-zero almost everywhere). The tests are consistent, while
much faster than state-of-the-art quadratic-time kernel-based tests. Experiments
on artificial

Nonstochastic Multiarmed Bandits with Unrestricted Delays,"Tobias Sommer Thune, Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi, Yevgeny Seldin","We investigate multiarmed bandits with delayed feedback, where the delays need neither be identical nor bounded. We first prove that ""delayed"" Exp3 achieves the $O(\sqrt{(KT + D)\ln K})$ regret bound conjectured by Cesa-Bianchi et al. [2016] in the case of variable, but bounded delays. Here, $K$ is the number of actions and $D$ is the total delay over $T$ rounds. We then introduce a new algorithm that lifts the requirement of bounded delays by using a wrapper that skips rounds with excessively large delays. 
The new algorithm maintains the same regret bound, but similar to its predecessor requires prior knowledge of $D$ and $T$. 
For this algorithm we then construct a novel doubling scheme that forgoes the prior knowledge requirement under the assumption that the delays are available at action time (rather than at loss observation time). This assumption is satisfied in a broad range of applications, including interaction with servers and service providers. 
The resulting oracle regret bound is of order $\min_\beta (|S_\beta|+\beta \ln K + (KT + D_\beta)/\beta)$, where $|S_\beta|$ is the number of observations with delay exceeding $\beta$, and $D_\beta$ is the total delay of observations with delay below $\beta$.

Approximate Bayesian Inference for a Mechanistic Model of Vesicle Release at a Ribbon Synapse,"Cornelius Schröder, Ben James, Leon Lagnado, Philipp Berens","The inherent noise of neural systems makes it difficult to construct models which accurately capture experimental measurements of their activity. While much research has been done on how to efficiently model neural activity with descriptive models such as linear-nonlinear-models (LN), Bayesian inference for mechanistic models has received considerably less attention. One reason for this is that these models typically lead to intractable likelihoods and thus make parameter inference difficult.  Here, we develop an approximate Bayesian inference scheme for a fully stochastic, biophysically inspired model of glutamate release at the ribbon synapse, a highly specialized synapse found in different sensory systems. The model translates known structural features of the ribbon synapse into a set of stochastically coupled equations. We approximate the posterior distributions by updating a parametric prior distribution via Bayesian updating rules and show that model parameters can be efficiently estimated for synthetic and experimental data from in vivo two-photon experiments in the zebrafish retina.

Data-dependent Sample Complexity of Deep Neural Networks via Lipschitz Augmentation,"Colin Wei, Tengyu Ma","Existing Rademacher complexity bounds for neural networks rely only on norm control of the weight matrices and depend exponentially on depth via a product of the matrix norms. Lower bounds show that this exponential dependence on depth is unavoidable when no additional properties of the training data are considered. We suspect that this conundrum comes from the fact that these bounds depend on the training data only through the margin. In practice, many data-dependent techniques such as Batchnorm improve the generalization performance. For feedforward neural nets as well as RNNs, we obtain tighter Rademacher complexity bounds by considering additional data-dependent properties of the network: the norms of the hidden layers of the network, and the norms of the Jacobians of each layer with respect to all previous layers. Our bounds scale polynomially in depth when these empirical quantities are small, as is usually the case in practice. To obtain these bounds, we develop general tools for augmenting a sequence of functions to make their composition Lipschitz and then covering the augmented functions. Inspired by our theory, we directly regularize the network’s Jacobians during training and empirically demonstrate that this improves test performance.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/0e79548081b4bd0df3c77c5ba2c23289-Paper.pdf,2019,"bounds, data, depth, network, norms, training, additional, complexity, depend, dependent","al, et, data, bounds, bound, covering, loss, lipschitz, norms, training","{'lipschitz': 0.43401614566383556, 'augmentation': 0.4084268623662683, 'dependent': 0.39027097692905316, 'complexity': 0.34652580819427076, 'sample': 0.3209365248967035, 'data': 0.2746150417968589, 'via': 0.24655050250329563, 'deep': 0.22428361460563223, 'networks': 0.2036196797510562, 'neural': 0.2036196797510562}","{'bounds': 0.3391364953666227, 'norms': 0.27373140570706184, 'jacobians': 0.26470885121736215, 'depth': 0.2440234237494844, 'rademacher': 0.22090311086678757, 'depend': 0.1688690719056113, 'additional': 0.15215344995556362, 'dependent': 0.15146100551762057, 'data': 0.143697397339503, 'layers': 0.14089105915169717}"
Semi-supervisedly Co-embedding Attributed Networks,"Zaiqiao Meng, Shangsong Liang, Jinyuan Fang, Teng Xiao","Deep generative models (DGMs) have achieved remarkable advances. Semi-supervised variational auto-encoders (SVAE) as a classical DGM offers a principled framework to effective generalize from small labelled data to large unlabelled ones, but it is difficult to incorporate rich unstructured relationships within the multiple heterogeneous entities. In this paper, to deal with the problem, we present a semi-supervised co-embedding model for attributed networks (SCAN) based on the generalized SVAE for the heterogeneous data, which collaboratively learns low- dimensional vector representations of both nodes and attributes for partially labelled attributed networks semi-supervisedly. The node and attribute embeddings obtained in a unified manner by our SCAN can benefit not only for capturing the proximities between nodes but also the affinities between nodes and attributes. Moreover, our model also trains a discriminative network to learn the label predictive distribution of nodes. Experimental results on real-world networks demonstrate that our model yields excellent performance in a number of applications such as attribute inference, user profiling and node classification compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/0e7c7d6c41c76b9ee6445ae01cc0181d-Paper.pdf,2019,"nodes, model, networks, semi, also, attribute, attributed, attributes, data, heterogeneous","latexit, sha1_base64, nodes, ab, model, semi, attributes, networks, supervised, network","{'attributed': 0.5051218262179852, 'supervisedly': 0.5051218262179852, 'co': 0.4126210780260084, 'embedding': 0.38022547903029424, 'semi': 0.3585116090450517, 'networks': 0.21528060433114113}","{'nodes': 0.3009474855865035, 'svae': 0.25686443514103646, 'scan': 0.23334520552037694, 'semi': 0.23282402381010142, 'labelled': 0.21958733814644082, 'attributed': 0.21435683972313446, 'attribute': 0.193352173333327, 'attributes': 0.18630674627905786, 'heterogeneous': 0.18047568216109902, 'node': 0.15198203892467643}"
Adaptive Auxiliary Task Weighting for Reinforcement Learning,"Xingyu Lin, Harjatin Baweja, George Kantor, David Held","Reinforcement learning is known to be sample inefficient, preventing its application to many real-world problems, especially with high dimensional observations like images. Transferring knowledge from other auxiliary tasks is a powerful tool for improving the learning efficiency. However, the usage of auxiliary tasks has been limited so far due to the difficulty in selecting and combining different auxiliary tasks. In this work, we propose a principled online learning algorithm that dynamically combines different auxiliary tasks to speed up training for reinforcement learning.  Our method is based on the idea that auxiliary tasks should provide gradient directions that, in the long term, help to decrease the loss of the main task.

Training Image Estimators without Image Ground Truth,"Zhihao Xia, Ayan Chakrabarti","Deep neural networks have been very successful in compressive-sensing and image restoration applications, as a means to estimate images from partial, blurry, or otherwise degraded measurements. These networks are trained on a large number of corresponding pairs of measurements and ground-truth images, and thus implicitly learn to exploit domain-specific image statistics. But unlike measurement data, it is often expensive or impractical to collect a large training set of ground-truth images in many application settings. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised framework for training image estimation networks, from a training set that contains only measurements---with two varied measurements per image---but no ground-truth for the full images desired as output. We demonstrate that our framework can be applied for both regular and blind image estimation tasks, where in the latter case parameters of the measurement model (e.g., the blur kernel) are unknown: during inference, and potentially, also during training. We evaluate our framework for training networks for compressive-sensing and blind deconvolution, considering both non-blind and blind training for the latter. Our framework yields models that are nearly as accurate as those from fully supervised training, despite not having access to any ground-truth images.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/0ed9422357395a0d4879191c66f4faa2-Paper.pdf,2019,"training, image, images, blind, framework, ground, measurements, networks, truth, compressive","training, image, images, measurement, blind, set, measurements, ground, truth, method","{'image': 0.5399932847320216, 'ground': 0.4314834654813785, 'truth': 0.4314834654813785, 'estimators': 0.37925694337677396, 'without': 0.3524677878411289, 'training': 0.2607334269163996}","{'blind': 0.3423568246634242, 'measurements': 0.29682011061956226, 'truth': 0.29682011061956226, 'images': 0.2721965765839672, 'ground': 0.2715544671876734, 'training': 0.24657838091483622, 'image': 0.22733342542228774, 'compressive': 0.19418896384540518, 'sensing': 0.1641402740499293, 'framework': 0.16365044291334477}"

Why can they fit random labels even given non-convex and non-smooth architectures? Most existing theory only covers networks with one hidden layer, so can we go deeper?

In this paper, we focus on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) which are multi-layer networks widely used in natural language processing.
They are harder to analyze than feedforward neural networks, because the \emph{same} recurrent unit is repeatedly applied across the entire time horizon of length $L$, which is analogous to feedforward networks of depth $L$. We show when the number of neurons is sufficiently large, meaning polynomial in the training data size and in $L$, then SGD is capable of minimizing the regression loss in the linear convergence rate. This gives theoretical evidence of how RNNs can memorize data.

More importantly, in this paper we build general toolkits to analyze multi-layer networks with ReLU activations. For instance, we prove why ReLU activations can prevent exponential gradient explosion or vanishing, and build a perturbation theory to analyze first-order approximation of multi-layer networks.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/0ee8b85a85a49346fdff9665312a5cc4-Paper.pdf,2019,"networks, layer, multi, analyze, neural, activations, build, data, feedforward, gradient","networks, rnn, layer, one, training, neural, hi, di, random, sgd","{'rate': 0.5051259342598585, 'recurrent': 0.45849105654957245, 'convergence': 0.454550684536205, 'training': 0.40549652832182936, 'networks': 0.28599823627845444, 'neural': 0.28599823627845444}","{'layer': 0.32160533675461933, 'networks': 0.31965683230711367, 'multi': 0.22256207819653212, 'analyze': 0.20948050879684116, 'feedforward': 0.19535180276324793, 'rnns': 0.1789110842588581, 'activations': 0.17579239086491824, 'relu': 0.16904877095020365, 'build': 0.16341613574428865, 'sgd': 0.15857968095471123}"
Minimizers of the Empirical Risk and Risk Monotonicity,"Marco Loog, Tom Viering, Alexander Mey","Plotting a learner's average performance against the number of training samples results in a learning curve.

Our work introduces the formal notion of risk monotonicity, which asks the risk to not deteriorate with increasing training set sizes in expectation over the training samples.  We then present the surprising result that various standard learners, specifically those that minimize the empirical risk, can act nonmonotonically irrespective of the training sample size.

These nonconvex regularizers are sharper than the nuclear norm; indeed, we show they are related to Schatten-$p$ norms with arbitrarily small $0 < p \leq 1$. Moreover, these factor group-sparse regularizers can be written in a factored form that enables efficient and effective nonconvex optimization; notably, the method does not use singular value decomposition. We provide generalization error bounds for low-rank matrix completion which show improved upper bounds for Schatten-$p$ norm reglarization as $p$ decreases.

Learning Fairness in Multi-Agent Systems,"Jiechuan Jiang, Zongqing Lu","Fairness is essential for human society, contributing to stability and productivity. Similarly, fairness is also the key for many multi-agent systems. Taking fairness into multi-agent learning could help multi-agent systems become both efficient and stable. However, learning efficiency and fairness simultaneously is a complex, multi-objective, joint-policy optimization. To tackle these difficulties, we propose FEN, a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning model. We first decompose fairness for each agent and propose fair-efficient reward that each agent learns its own policy to optimize. To avoid multi-objective conflict, we design a hierarchy consisting of a controller and several sub-policies, where the controller maximizes the fair-efficient reward by switching among the sub-policies that provides diverse behaviors to interact with the environment. FEN can be trained in a fully decentralized way, making it easy to be deployed in real-world applications. Empirically, we show that FEN easily learns both fairness and efficiency and significantly outperforms baselines in a variety of multi-agent scenarios.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/10493aa88605cad5ab4752b04a63d172-Paper.pdf,2019,"agent, fairness, multi, efficient, fen, learning, controller, efficiency, fair, learns","agent, agents, fen, reward, sub, fairness, policy, policies, efﬁcient, controller","{'systems': 0.542548314371448, 'agent': 0.5096592598151198, 'fairness': 0.5030310931237373, 'multi': 0.38396637618121976, 'learning': 0.21311571216220732}","{'fairness': 0.4422073643066755, 'agent': 0.346948697314743, 'fen': 0.33943474865328893, 'multi': 0.2910952544662263, 'controller': 0.1888419208977817, 'fair': 0.15899364134430846, 'reward': 0.13256283620554624, 'sub': 0.13191996721046848, 'efficient': 0.13162098956552895, 'policies': 0.12776983263923353}"

In this paper we study the three critical components of the Lottery Ticket (LT) algorithm, showing that each may be varied significantly without impacting the overall results. Ablating these factors leads to new insights for why LT networks perform as well as they do. We show why setting weights to zero is important, how signs are all you need to make the re-initialized network train, and why masking behaves like training.

Low-Complexity Nonparametric Bayesian Online Prediction with Universal Guarantees,"Alix LHERITIER, Frederic Cazals","We propose a novel nonparametric online predictor for discrete labels conditioned on multivariate continuous features. The predictor is based on a feature space discretization induced by a full-fledged k-d tree with randomly picked directions and a recursive Bayesian distribution, which allows to automatically learn the most relevant feature scales characterizing the conditional distribution.

Finding the Needle in the Haystack with Convolutions: on the benefits of architectural bias,"Stéphane d'Ascoli, Levent Sagun, Giulio Biroli, Joan Bruna","Despite the phenomenal success of deep neural networks in a broad range of learning tasks, there is a lack of theory to understand the way they work. In particular, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are known to perform much better than Fully-Connected Networks (FCNs) on spatially structured data: the architectural structure of CNNs benefits from prior knowledge on the features of the data, for instance their translation invariance. The aim of this work is to 
understand this fact through the lens of dynamics in the loss landscape.We introduce a method that maps a CNN to its equivalent FCN (denoted as eFCN). Such an embedding enables the comparison of CNN and FCN training dynamics directly in the FCN space.
We use this method to test a new training protocol, which consists in training a CNN, embedding it to FCN space at a certain ``relax time'', then resuming the training in FCN space. We observe that for all relax times, the deviation from the CNN subspace is small, and the final performance reached by the eFCN is higher than that reachable by a standard FCN of same architecture. More surprisingly, for some intermediate relax times, the eFCN outperforms the CNN it stemmed, by combining the prior information of the CNN and the expressivity of the FCN in a complementary way. The practical interest of our protocol is limited by the very large size of the highly sparse eFCN. However, it offers interesting insights into the persistence of architectural bias under stochastic gradient dynamics. It shows the existence of some rare basins in the FCN loss landscape associated with very good generalization. These can only be accessed thanks to the CNN prior, which helps navigate the landscape during the early stages of optimization.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/124c3e4ada4a529aa0fedece80bb42ab-Paper.pdf,2019,"fcn, cnn, efcn, training, dynamics, landscape, networks, prior, relax, space","cnn, efcn, fcn, tw, training, 10, local, efcns, epochs, loss","{'architectural': 0.40048290452854185, 'benefits': 0.40048290452854185, 'haystack': 0.40048290452854185, 'needle': 0.40048290452854185, 'finding': 0.3790327155095477, 'convolutions': 0.35200867332586605, 'bias': 0.3014595614644747}","{'fcn': 0.6108823914085353, 'cnn': 0.3507490925132812, 'efcn': 0.30544119570426764, 'relax': 0.20135307062388508, 'landscape': 0.16432046597171773, 'architectural': 0.1247535435052247, 'protocol': 0.1247535435052247, 'dynamics': 0.11388768127048089, 'cnns': 0.10434554180821129, 'prior': 0.10394683679489004}"

Regarding efficiency, we introduce a noisy zero-order method that converges to second order stationary points, i.e avoids saddle points.

Learning metrics for persistence-based summaries and applications for graph classification,"Qi Zhao, Yusu Wang","Recently a new feature representation and data analysis methodology based on a topological tool called persistent homology (and its persistence diagram summary) has gained much momentum. A series of methods have been developed to map a persistence diagram to a vector representation so as to facilitate the downstream use of machine learning tools. In these approaches, the importance (weight) of different persistence features are usually pre-set. However often in practice, the choice of the weight-function should depend on the nature of the specific data at hand. It is thus highly desirable to learn a best weight-function (and thus metric for persistence diagrams) from labelled data. We study this problem and develop a new weighted kernel, called WKPI, for persistence summaries, as well as an optimization framework to learn the weight (and thus kernel). We apply the learned kernel to the challenging task of graph classification, and show that our WKPI-based classification framework obtains similar or (sometimes significantly) better results than the best results from a range of previous graph classification frameworks on a collection of benchmark datasets.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/12780ea688a71dabc284b064add459a4-Paper.pdf,2019,"persistence, weight, classification, data, kernel, thus, based, best, called, diagram","persistence, function, kernel, wkpi, graph, weight, data, distance, images, set","{'persistence': 0.46288286478928725, 'summaries': 0.46288286478928725, 'metrics': 0.43809048331404726, 'applications': 0.370915245767392, 'classification': 0.3037400082207367, 'graph': 0.2559425071800878, 'based': 0.25096858443221054, 'learning': 0.14569737783650893}","{'persistence': 0.5623688244412857, 'weight': 0.28270282376332206, 'wkpi': 0.23767774232973782, 'diagram': 0.21591530022869818, 'kernel': 0.19712925850193574, 'thus': 0.17043337951983842, 'classification': 0.14565710358527842, 'homology': 0.11883887116486891, 'called': 0.11781468036799728, 'diagrams': 0.11247376488825715}"
PasteGAN: A Semi-Parametric Method to Generate Image from Scene Graph,"Yikang LI, Tao Ma, Yeqi Bai, Nan Duan, Sining Wei, Xiaogang Wang","Despite some exciting progress on high-quality image generation from structured (scene graphs) or free-form (sentences) descriptions, most of them only guarantee the image-level semantical consistency, i.e. the generated image matching the semantic meaning of the description. They still lack the investigations on synthesizing the images in a more controllable way, like finely manipulating the visual appearance of every object. Therefore, to generate the images with preferred objects and rich interactions, we propose a semi-parametric method, PasteGAN, for generating the image from the scene graph and the image crops, where spatial arrangements of the objects and their pair-wise relationships are defined by the scene graph and the object appearances are determined by the given object crops. To enhance the interactions of the objects in the output, we design a Crop Refining Network and an Object-Image Fuser to embed the objects as well as their relationships into one map. Multiple losses work collaboratively to guarantee the generated images highly respecting the crops and complying with the scene graphs while maintaining excellent image quality. A crop selector is also proposed to pick the most-compatible crops from our external object tank by encoding the interactions around the objects in the scene graph if the crops are not provided. Evaluated on Visual Genome and COCO-Stuff dataset, our proposed method significantly outperforms the SOTA methods on Inception Score, Diversity Score and Fréchet Inception Distance. Extensive experiments also demonstrate our method’s ability to generate complex and diverse images with given objects.

A Unified Bellman Optimality Principle Combining Reward Maximization and Empowerment,"Felix Leibfried, Sergio Pascual-Díaz, Jordi Grau-Moya","Empowerment is an information-theoretic method that can be used to intrinsically motivate learning agents. It attempts to maximize an agent's control over the environment by encouraging visiting states with a large number of reachable next states. Empowered learning has been shown to lead to complex behaviors, without requiring an explicit reward signal. In this paper, we investigate the use of empowerment in the presence of an extrinsic reward signal. We hypothesize that empowerment can guide reinforcement learning (RL) agents to find good early behavioral solutions by encouraging highly empowered states.
We propose a unified Bellman optimality principle for empowered reward maximization. Our empowered reward maximization approach generalizes both Bellman’s optimality principle as well as recent information-theoretical extensions to it. We prove uniqueness of the empowered values and show convergence to the optimal solution.

Learning Representations for Time Series Clustering,"Qianli Ma, Jiawei Zheng, Sen Li, Gary W. Cottrell","Time series clustering is an essential unsupervised technique in cases when category information is not available. It has been widely applied to genome data, anomaly detection, and in general, in any domain where pattern detection is important. Although feature-based time series clustering methods are robust to noise and outliers, and can reduce the  dimensionality of the data, they typically rely on domain knowledge to manually construct high-quality features. Sequence to sequence (seq2seq) models can learn representations from sequence data in an unsupervised manner by designing appropriate learning objectives, such as reconstruction and context prediction. When applying seq2seq to time series clustering, obtaining a representation that effectively represents the temporal dynamics of the sequence, multi-scale features, and good clustering properties remains a challenge. How to best improve the ability of the encoder is still an open question. Here we propose a novel unsupervised temporal representation learning model, named Deep Temporal Clustering Representation (DTCR), which integrates the temporal reconstruction and K-means objective into the seq2seq model. This approach leads to improved cluster structures and thus obtains cluster-specific temporal representations. Also, to enhance the ability of encoder, we propose a fake-sample generation strategy and auxiliary classification task. Experiments conducted on extensive time series datasets show that DTCR is state-of-the-art compared to existing methods. The visualization analysis not only shows the effectiveness of cluster-specific representation but also shows the learning process is robust, even if K-means makes mistakes.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/1359aa933b48b754a2f54adb688bfa77-Paper.pdf,2019,"clustering, temporal, representation, sequence, series, time, cluster, data, learning, seq2seq","10, time, series, dtcr, means, representations, clustering, cluster, encoder, loss","{'series': 0.5478027498199726, 'clustering': 0.5042384287115489, 'representations': 0.4609370798332048, 'time': 0.4268083065073592, 'learning': 0.22589252362870016}","{'clustering': 0.32185937319243696, 'temporal': 0.297475425947875, 'seq2seq': 0.28208754397752994, 'series': 0.23908526109610168, 'sequence': 0.22447914428938345, 'cluster': 0.21817436452127154, 'dtcr': 0.20701306027843536, 'representation': 0.18245565250921134, 'unsupervised': 0.1745757489957863, 'time': 0.13872449669534614}"

Probabilistic Logic Neural Networks for Reasoning,"Meng Qu, Jian Tang","Knowledge graph reasoning, which aims at predicting missing facts through reasoning with observed facts, is critical for many applications. Such a problem has been widely explored by traditional logic rule-based approaches and recent knowledge graph embedding methods. A principled logic rule-based approach is the Markov Logic Network (MLN), which is able to leverage domain knowledge with first-order logic and meanwhile handle uncertainty. However, the inference in MLNs is usually very difficult due to the complicated graph structures. Different from MLNs, knowledge graph embedding methods (e.g. TransE, DistMult) learn effective entity and relation embeddings for reasoning, which are much more effective and efficient. However, they are unable to leverage domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose the probabilistic Logic Neural Network (pLogicNet), which combines the advantages of both methods. A pLogicNet defines the joint distribution of all possible triplets by using a Markov logic network with first-order logic, which can be efficiently optimized with the variational EM algorithm. Specifically, in the E-step, a knowledge graph embedding model is used for inferring the missing triplets, while in the M-step, the weights of the logic rules are updated according to both the observed and predicted triplets.

Joint-task Self-supervised Learning for Temporal Correspondence,"Xueting Li, Sifei Liu, Shalini De Mello, Xiaolong Wang, Jan Kautz, Ming-Hsuan Yang","This paper proposes to learn reliable dense correspondence from videos in a self-supervised manner. Our learning process integrates two highly related tasks: tracking large image regions and establishing fine-grained pixel-level associations between consecutive video frames. We exploit the synergy between both tasks through a shared inter-frame affinity matrix, which simultaneously models transitions between video frames at both the region- and pixel-levels. While region-level localization helps reduce ambiguities in fine-grained matching by narrowing down search regions; fine-grained matching provides bottom-up features to facilitate region-level localization. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art self-supervised methods on a variety of visual correspondence tasks, including video-object and part-segmentation propagation, keypoint tracking, and object tracking.

On Distributed Averaging for Stochastic k-PCA,"Aditya Bhaskara, Pruthuvi Maheshakya Wijewardena","In the stochastic k-PCA problem, we are given i.i.d. samples from an unknown distribution over vectors, and the goal is to compute the top k eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the moment matrix.

Each machine performs some computation and sends an O(k) size summary of the local dataset to a central server. The server performs an aggregation and computes the desired eigenvalues and vectors. The goal is to achieve the same effect as the server computing using m*n samples by itself. The main choices in this framework are the choice of the summary, and the method of aggregation. We consider a slight variant of the well-studied ""distributed averaging"" approach, and prove that this leads to significantly better bounds on the dependence between 'n' and the eigenvalue gaps.

Online Continual Learning with Maximal Interfered Retrieval,"Rahaf Aljundi, Eugene Belilovsky, Tinne Tuytelaars, Laurent Charlin, Massimo Caccia, Min Lin, Lucas Page-Caccia","Continual learning, the setting where a learning agent is faced with a never-ending stream of data, continues to be a great challenge for modern machine learning systems. In particular the online or ""single-pass through the data"" setting has gained attention recently as a natural setting that is difficult to tackle. Methods based on replay, either generative or from a stored memory, have been shown to be effective approaches for continual learning, matching or exceeding the state of the art in a number of standard benchmarks. These approaches typically rely on randomly selecting samples from the replay memory or from a generative model, which is suboptimal. In this work, we consider a controlled sampling of memories for replay. We retrieve the samples which are most interfered, i.e. whose prediction will be most negatively impacted by the foreseen parameters update. We show a formulation for this sampling criterion in both the generative replay and the experience replay setting, producing consistent gains in performance and greatly reduced forgetting.

Learning to Predict Without Looking Ahead: World Models Without Forward Prediction,"Daniel Freeman, David Ha, Luke Metz","Much of model-based reinforcement learning involves learning a model of an agent's world, and training an agent to leverage this model to perform a task more efficiently. While these models are demonstrably useful for agents, every naturally occurring model of the world of which we are aware---e.g., a brain---arose as the byproduct of competing evolutionary pressures for survival, not minimization of a supervised forward-predictive loss via gradient descent.  That useful models can arise out of the messy and slow optimization process of evolution suggests that forward-predictive modeling can arise as a side-effect of optimization under the right circumstances. Crucially, this optimization process need not explicitly be a forward-predictive loss. In this work, we introduce a modification to traditional reinforcement learning which we call observational dropout, whereby we limit the agents ability to observe the real environment at each timestep. In doing so, we can coerce an agent into learning a world model to fill in the observation gaps during reinforcement learning. We show that the emerged world model, while not explicitly trained to predict the future, can help the agent learn key skills required to perform well in its environment.

Deep Generalized Method of Moments for Instrumental Variable Analysis,"Andrew Bennett, Nathan Kallus, Tobias Schnabel","Instrumental variable analysis is a powerful tool for estimating causal effects when randomization or full control of confounders is not possible.

Copulas as High-Dimensional Generative Models: Vine Copula Autoencoders,"Natasa Tagasovska, Damien Ackerer, Thibault Vatter","We introduce the vine copula autoencoder (VCAE), a flexible generative model for high-dimensional distributions built in a straightforward three-step procedure.

Implicit Semantic Data Augmentation for Deep Networks,"Yulin Wang, Xuran Pan, Shiji Song, Hong Zhang, Gao Huang, Cheng Wu","In this paper, we propose a novel implicit semantic data augmentation (ISDA) approach to complement traditional augmentation techniques like flipping, translation or rotation. Our work is motivated by the intriguing property that deep networks are surprisingly good at linearizing features, such that certain directions in the deep feature space correspond to meaningful semantic transformations, e.g., adding sunglasses or changing backgrounds. As a consequence, translating training samples along many semantic directions in the feature space can effectively augment the dataset to improve generalization. To implement this idea effectively and efficiently, we first perform an online estimate of the covariance matrix of deep features for each class, which captures the intra-class semantic variations. Then random vectors are drawn from a zero-mean normal distribution with the estimated covariance to augment the training data in that class. Importantly, instead of augmenting the samples explicitly, we can directly minimize an upper bound of the expected cross-entropy (CE) loss on the augmented training set, leading to a highly efficient algorithm. In fact, we show that the proposed ISDA amounts to minimizing a novel robust CE loss, which adds negligible extra computational cost to a normal training procedure. Although being simple, ISDA consistently improves the generalization performance of popular deep models (ResNets and DenseNets) on a variety of datasets, e.g., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet.

RUDDER: Return Decomposition for Delayed Rewards,"Jose A. Arjona-Medina, Michael Gillhofer, Michael Widrich, Thomas Unterthiner, Johannes Brandstetter, Sepp Hochreiter","We propose RUDDER, a novel reinforcement learning approach for delayed rewards in finite Markov decision processes (MDPs). In MDPs the Q-values are equal to the expected immediate reward plus the expected future rewards. The latter are related to bias problems in temporal difference (TD) learning and to high variance problems in Monte Carlo (MC) learning. Both problems are even more severe when rewards are delayed. RUDDER aims at making the expected future rewards zero, which simplifies Q-value estimation to computing the mean of the immediate reward. We propose the following two new concepts to push the expected future rewards toward zero. (i) Reward redistribution that leads to return-equivalent decision processes with the same optimal policies and, when optimal, zero expected future rewards. (ii) Return decomposition via contribution analysis which transforms the reinforcement learning task into a regression task at which deep learning excels. On artificial tasks with delayed rewards, RUDDER is significantly faster than MC and exponentially faster than Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), TD(λ), and reward shaping approaches.

Learning-Based Low-Rank Approximations,"Piotr Indyk, Ali Vakilian, Yang Yuan","We introduce a “learning-based” algorithm for the low-rank decomposition problem: given an $n \times d$ matrix $A$, and a parameter $k$,  compute a rank-$k$ matrix $A'$ that  minimizes the approximation loss $\|A-A'\|_F$. The algorithm uses a training set of input matrices in order to optimize its performance. 
Specifically, some of the most efficient approximate algorithms for computing low-rank approximations proceed by computing a projection $SA$, where  $S$ is a sparse random $m \times n$ “sketching matrix”, and then performing the singular value decomposition of $SA$. We 
 show how to replace the random matrix $S$ with a “learned” matrix of the same sparsity to reduce the error. 
Our experiments show that,  for multiple types of data sets, 
a learned sketch matrix can substantially reduce the approximation loss compared to a random matrix $S$, sometimes up to one order of magnitude. We also study mixed matrices where only some of the rows are trained and the remaining ones are random, and show that matrices still offer improved performance while retaining worst-case guarantees. 

Finally, to understand the theoretical aspects of our approach, we study the special case of $m=1$. In particular, we give an approximation algorithm for minimizing the empirical loss, with approximation factor depending on the stable rank of matrices in the training set.

Convergence Guarantees for Adaptive Bayesian Quadrature Methods,"Motonobu Kanagawa, Philipp Hennig","Adaptive Bayesian quadrature (ABQ) is a powerful approach to numerical integration that empirically compares favorably with Monte Carlo integration on problems of medium dimensionality (where non-adaptive quadrature is not competitive).

Nevertheless, the use of such solvers severely limits the applicability of DRO in large-scale learning problems, as they often rely on general purpose interior-point algorithms. On the other hand, there are very few works that attempt to develop fast iterative methods to solve these DRO problems, which typically possess complicated structures. In this paper, we take a first step towards resolving the above difficulty by developing a first-order algorithmic framework for tackling a class of Wasserstein distance-based distributionally robust logistic regression (DRLR) problem. Specifically, we propose a novel linearized proximal ADMM to solve the DRLR problem, whose objective is convex but consists of a smooth term plus two non-separable non-smooth terms. We prove that our method enjoys a sublinear convergence rate. Furthermore, we conduct three different experiments to show its superb performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets. In particular, our method can achieve the same accuracy up to 800+ times faster than the standard off-the-shelf solver.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/169779d3852b32ce8b1a1724dbf5217d-Paper.pdf,2019,"dro, learning, problems, based, convex, distance, distributionally, drlr, first, method","admm, yk, problem, lp, xi, ﬁrst, order, framework, drlr, subproblem","{'distributionally': 0.40073343804935646, 'logistic': 0.40073343804935646, 'algorithmic': 0.39118809889830997, 'first': 0.37562617303343027, 'order': 0.34399475998124446, 'framework': 0.3123633469290587, 'regression': 0.2990431911179121, 'robust': 0.28173069963638836}","{'dro': 0.43443681201957685, 'drlr': 0.23911219018840416, 'distributionally': 0.2101701817792916, 'shelf': 0.18827639760067583, 'solvers': 0.17151594508257348, 'wasserstein': 0.1461089820026665, 'problems': 0.13406420774735767, 'smooth': 0.13221265704445778, 'distance': 0.12421519782405076, 'solve': 0.12143223692694512}"
Theoretical Analysis of Adversarial Learning: A Minimax Approach,"Zhuozhuo Tu, Jingwei Zhang, Dacheng Tao","In this paper, we propose a general theoretical method for analyzing the risk bound in the presence of adversaries. Specifically, we try to fit the adversarial learning problem into the minimax framework. We first show that the original adversarial learning problem can be transformed into a minimax statistical learning problem by introducing a transport map between distributions. Then, we prove a new risk bound for this minimax problem in terms of covering numbers under a weak version of Lipschitz condition. Our method can be applied to multi-class classification and popular loss functions including the hinge loss and ramp loss.

Compositional De-Attention Networks,"Yi Tay, Anh Tuan Luu, Aston Zhang, Shuohang Wang, Siu Cheung Hui","Attentional models are distinctly characterized by their ability to learn relative importance, i.e., assigning a different weight to input values. This paper proposes a new quasi-attention that is compositional in nature, i.e., learning whether to \textit{add}, \textit{subtract} or \textit{nullify} a certain vector when learning representations. This is strongly contrasted with vanilla attention, which simply re-weights input tokens. Our proposed \textit{Compositional De-Attention} (CoDA) is fundamentally built upon the intuition of both similarity and dissimilarity (negative affinity) when computing affinity scores, benefiting from a greater extent of expressiveness.

Robust Attribution Regularization,"Jiefeng Chen, Xi Wu, Vaibhav Rastogi, Yingyu Liang, Somesh Jha","An emerging problem in trustworthy machine learning is to train models that produce robust interpretations for their predictions. We take a step towards solving this problem through the lens of axiomatic attribution of neural networks. Our theory is grounded in the recent work, Integrated Gradients (IG) [STY17], in axiomatically attributing a neural network’s output change to its input change. We propose training objectives in classic robust optimization models to achieve robust IG attributions. Our objectives give principled generalizations of previous objectives designed for robust predictions, and they naturally degenerate to classic soft-margin training for one-layer neural networks. We also generalize previous theory and prove that the objectives for different robust optimization models are closely related.

Semantic-Guided Multi-Attention Localization for Zero-Shot Learning,"Yizhe Zhu, Jianwen Xie, Zhiqiang Tang, Xi Peng, Ahmed Elgammal","Zero-shot learning extends the conventional object classification to the unseen class recognition by introducing semantic representations of classes. Existing approaches predominantly focus on learning the proper mapping function for visual-semantic embedding, while neglecting the effect of learning discriminative visual features. In this paper, we study the significance of the discriminative region localization. We propose a semantic-guided multi-attention localization model, which automatically discovers the most discriminative parts of objects for zero-shot learning without any human annotations. Our model jointly learns cooperative global and local features from the whole object as well as the detected parts to categorize objects based on semantic descriptions. Moreover, with the joint supervision of embedding softmax loss and class-center triplet loss, the model is encouraged to learn features with high inter-class dispersion and intra-class compactness. Through comprehensive experiments on three widely used zero-shot learning benchmarks, we show the efficacy of the multi-attention localization and our proposed approach improves the state-of-the-art results by a considerable margin.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/172fd0d638b3282151bd8f3d652cb640-Paper.pdf,2019,"learning, class, semantic, discriminative, features, localization, model, shot, zero, attention","attention, part, learning, loss, shot, zero, class, features, model, parts","{'localization': 0.4426231766486553, 'guided': 0.411358090194741, 'zero': 0.3695424469537308, 'semantic': 0.3652492834175, 'shot': 0.3612164761700996, 'attention': 0.357414244359374, 'multi': 0.28557693305160303, 'learning': 0.15850588811887786}","{'semantic': 0.28224853245843295, 'localization': 0.2809449318640972, 'discriminative': 0.24107059201858763, 'shot': 0.23262223237443116, 'class': 0.21625409526058845, 'zero': 0.21616477501455963, 'features': 0.17663214323562526, 'parts': 0.1743840115550399, 'embedding': 0.14951581330142963, 'objects': 0.14738573236028732}"
Distributionally Robust Optimization and Generalization in Kernel Methods,"Matthew Staib, Stefanie Jegelka","Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) has attracted attention in machine learning due to its connections to regularization, generalization, and robustness. Existing work has considered uncertainty sets based on phi-divergences and Wasserstein distances, each of which have drawbacks. In this paper, we study DRO with uncertainty sets measured via maximum mean discrepancy (MMD). We show that MMD DRO is roughly equivalent to regularization by the Hilbert norm and, as a byproduct, reveal deep connections to classic results in statistical learning. In particular, we obtain an alternative proof of a generalization bound for Gaussian kernel ridge regression via a DRO lense. The proof also suggests a new regularizer.

Kernel Instrumental Variable Regression,"Rahul Singh, Maneesh Sahani, Arthur Gretton","Instrumental variable (IV) regression is a strategy for learning causal relationships in observational data. If measurements of input X and output Y are confounded, the causal relationship can nonetheless be identified if an instrumental variable Z is available that influences X directly, but is conditionally independent of Y given X and the unmeasured confounder. The classic two-stage least squares algorithm (2SLS) simplifies the estimation problem by modeling all relationships as linear functions. We propose kernel instrumental variable regression (KIV), a nonparametric generalization of 2SLS, modeling relations among X, Y, and Z as nonlinear functions in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs). We prove the consistency of KIV under mild assumptions, and derive conditions under which convergence occurs at the minimax optimal rate for unconfounded, single-stage RKHS regression. In doing so, we obtain an efficient ratio between training sample sizes used in the algorithm's first and second stages.

Zero-shot Learning via Simultaneous Generating and Learning,"Hyeonwoo Yu, Beomhee Lee","To overcome the absence of training data for unseen classes, conventional zero-shot learning approaches mainly train their model on seen datapoints and leverage the semantic descriptions for both seen and unseen classes.
Beyond exploiting relations between classes of seen and unseen, we present a deep generative model to provide the model with experience about both seen and unseen classes.
Based on the variational auto-encoder with class-specific multi-modal prior, the proposed method learns the conditional distribution of seen and unseen classes.
In order to circumvent the need for samples of unseen classes, we treat the non-existing data as missing examples.

Since we obtain the conditional generative model for both seen and unseen classes, classification as well as generation can be performed directly without any off-the-shell classifiers.

Direct Optimization through $\arg \max$ for Discrete Variational Auto-Encoder,"Guy Lorberbom, Andreea Gane, Tommi Jaakkola, Tamir Hazan","Reparameterization of variational auto-encoders with continuous random variables is an effective method for reducing the variance of their gradient estimates.

In contrast to previous works which resort to \emph{softmax}-based relaxations, we propose to optimize it directly by applying the \emph{direct loss minimization} approach.

We consider the setting where the goal is to predict a target variable based on the learned representation of high-dimensional observations (such as images) that depend on both the target variable and an unobserved sensitive variable.
We show that in this setting both the optimal and empirical predictions can be unfair, even if the target variable and the sensitive variable are independent.

When to use parametric models in reinforcement learning?,"Hado P. van Hasselt, Matteo Hessel, John Aslanides","We examine the question of when and how parametric models are most useful in reinforcement learning.  In particular, we look at commonalities and differences between parametric models and experience replay.  Replay-based learning algorithms share important traits with model-based approaches, including the ability to plan: to use more computation without additional data to improve predictions and behaviour. We discuss when to expect benefits from either approach, and interpret prior work in this context. We hypothesise that, under suitable conditions, replay-based algorithms should be competitive to or better than model-based algorithms if the model is used only to generate fictional transitions from observed states for an update rule that is otherwise model-free. We validated this hypothesis on Atari 2600 video games. The replay-based algorithm attained state-of-the-art data efficiency, improving over prior results with parametric models. Additionally, we discuss different ways to use models. We show that it can be better to plan backward than to plan forward when using models to perform credit assignment (e.g., to directly learn a value or policy), even though the latter seems more common.  Finally, we argue and demonstrate that it can be beneficial to plan forward for immediate behaviour, rather than for credit assignment.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/1b742ae215adf18b75449c6e272fd92d-Paper.pdf,2019,"based, models, model, plan, replay, algorithms, parametric, assignment, behaviour, better","model, replay, al, et, state, learning, planning, states, algorithm, forward","{'use': 0.6053215823575425, 'parametric': 0.5696322523364508, 'models': 0.3655021377032921, 'reinforcement': 0.3626625134410635, 'learning': 0.20973547079403895}","{'plan': 0.3843668955499145, 'replay': 0.3479100704992578, 'parametric': 0.22239529614395334, 'credit': 0.19218344777495724, 'behaviour': 0.1830692415122931, 'assignment': 0.1739550352496289, 'models': 0.1732966320746994, 'discuss': 0.1653397609241634, 'based': 0.16038810679706172, 'forward': 0.1500743963787797}"
Ouroboros: On Accelerating Training of Transformer-Based Language Models,"Qian Yang, Zhouyuan Huo, Wenlin Wang, Lawrence Carin","Language models are essential for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as machine translation and text summarization.

We apply the new representation to three tasks: theoretical analysis, model reduction, and interpretation. The polynomial form of a tree ensemble allows a straightforward interpretation of the original model. In our experiments, it shows comparable results with state-of-the-art interpretation techniques. Another application of the framework is the ensemble-wise pruning: we can drop monomials from the polynomial, based on train data statistics. This way we reduce the model size up to 3 times without loss of its quality. It is possible to show the equivalence of tree shape classes that share the same polynomial. This fact gives us the ability to train a model in one tree's shape and exploit it in another, which is easier for computation or interpretation.

Correlation Priors for Reinforcement Learning,"Bastian Alt, Adrian Šošić, Heinz Koeppl","Many decision-making problems naturally exhibit pronounced structures inherited
from the characteristics of the underlying environment. In a Markov decision process
model, for example, two distinct states can have inherently related semantics

In order to complete a certain task in such environments, the operating agent usually needs to execute a series of temporally and spatially correlated actions. Though there exists a variety of approaches to capture these correlations in continuous state-action domains, a principled solution for discrete environments is missing. In this work, we present a Bayesian learning framework based on Pólya-Gamma augmentation that enables an analogous reasoning in such cases. We demonstrate the framework on a number of common decision-making related problems, such as imitation learning, subgoal extraction, system identification and Bayesian reinforcement learning.

Specifically, we consider a hierarchical network storing the hierarchical categorical information of objects, and information retrieval goes from rough to fine, aided by dynamical push-pull feedback from higher to lower layers. We elucidate that the push (positive) and pull (negative) feedbacks suppress the interferences due to neural correlations between different and the same categories, respectively, and their joint effect improves retrieval performance significantly.

Joint Optimization of Tree-based Index and Deep Model for Recommender Systems,"Han Zhu, Daqing Chang, Ziru Xu, Pengye Zhang, Xiang Li, Jie He, Han Li, Jian Xu, Kun Gai","Large-scale industrial recommender systems are usually confronted with computational problems due to the enormous corpus size.  To retrieve and recommend the most relevant items to users under response time limits, resorting to an efficient index structure is an effective and practical solution.  The previous work Tree-based Deep Model (TDM) \cite{zhu2018learning} greatly improves recommendation accuracy using tree index.  By indexing items in a tree hierarchy and training a user-node preference prediction model satisfying a max-heap like property in the tree, TDM provides logarithmic computational complexity w.r.t. the corpus size, enabling the use of arbitrary advanced models in candidate retrieval and recommendation.In tree-based recommendation methods, the quality of both the tree index and the user-node preference prediction model determines the recommendation accuracy for the most part.  We argue that the learning of tree index and preference model has interdependence.  Our purpose, in this paper, is to develop a method to jointly learn the index structure and user preference prediction model.  In our proposed joint optimization framework, the learning of index and user preference prediction model are carried out under a unified performance measure.  Besides, we come up with a novel hierarchical user preference representation utilizing the tree index hierarchy.  Experimental evaluations with two large-scale real-world datasets show that the proposed method improves recommendation accuracy significantly.  Online A/B test results at a display advertising platform also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in production environments.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/1c6a0198177bfcc9bd93f6aab94aad3c-Paper.pdf,2019,"tree, index, model, preference, recommendation, user, prediction, accuracy, method, proposed","user, tree, preference, model, index, level, node, learning, item, prediction","{'recommender': 0.44668262894636546, 'index': 0.42275794523563315, 'joint': 0.38185842829012406, 'systems': 0.3579337445793918, 'tree': 0.3517168914832662, 'model': 0.257943225478368, 'based': 0.24218504421882014, 'optimization': 0.2344213114562331, 'deep': 0.20969381903125275}","{'index': 0.44525365495220603, 'tree': 0.37385200258737133, 'preference': 0.36902089268184496, 'recommendation': 0.2878727001242741, 'user': 0.2499185378545167, 'tdm': 0.1587580911303983, 'prediction': 0.14943659572176735, 'corpus': 0.12968541707660586, 'model': 0.12301239968859992, 'hierarchy': 0.117949433829253}"
Accurate Uncertainty Estimation and Decomposition in Ensemble Learning,"Jeremiah Liu, John Paisley, Marianthi-Anna Kioumourtzoglou, Brent Coull","Ensemble learning is a standard approach to building machine learning systems that capture complex phenomena in real-world data.

The core of the difficulty is the non-convexity of the objective function, implying that standard optimization algorithms may converge to sub-optimal critical points. Our analysis focuses on loss functions that arise from elliptical distributions, which appealingly include most loss functions proposed in the literature as special cases. We show that, even though these problems are non-convex, they can be optimized efficiently. Concretely, we prove that at the limit of infinite training data, due to algebraic properties of the problem, all stationary points are globally optimal.

MixMatch: A Holistic Approach to Semi-Supervised Learning,"David Berthelot, Nicholas Carlini, Ian Goodfellow, Nicolas Papernot, Avital Oliver, Colin A.

In this work, we unify the current dominant approaches for semi-supervised learning to produce a new algorithm, MixMatch, that
guesses low-entropy labels for data-augmented unlabeled examples and mixes labeled and unlabeled data using MixUp.
MixMatch obtains state-of-the-art results by a large margin across many datasets and labeled data amounts. For example,
on CIFAR-10 with 250 labels, we reduce error rate by a factor of 4 (from 38% to 11%) and by a factor of 2 on STL-10.
We also demonstrate how MixMatch can help achieve a dramatically better accuracy-privacy trade-off for differential privacy.
Finally, we perform an ablation study to tease apart which components of MixMatch are most important for its success.

Preventing Gradient Attenuation in Lipschitz Constrained Convolutional Networks,"Qiyang Li, Saminul Haque, Cem Anil, James Lucas, Roger B. Grosse, Joern-Henrik Jacobsen","Lipschitz constraints under L2 norm on deep neural networks are useful for provable adversarial robustness bounds, stable training, and Wasserstein distance estimation. While heuristic approaches such as the gradient penalty have seen much practical success, it is challenging to achieve similar practical performance while provably enforcing a Lipschitz constraint. In principle, one can design Lipschitz constrained architectures using the composition property of Lipschitz functions, but Anil et al. recently identified a key obstacle to this approach: gradient norm attenuation. They showed how to circumvent this problem in the case of fully connected networks by designing each layer to be gradient norm preserving. We extend their approach to train scalable, expressive, provably Lipschitz convolutional networks. In particular, we present the Block Convolution Orthogonal Parameterization (BCOP), an expressive parameterization of orthogonal convolution operations. We show that even though the space of orthogonal convolutions is disconnected, the largest connected component of BCOP with 2n channels can represent arbitrary BCOP convolutions over n channels. Our BCOP parameterization allows us to train large convolutional networks with provable Lipschitz bounds.

Learning to Confuse: Generating Training Time Adversarial Data with Auto-Encoder,"Ji Feng, Qi-Zhi Cai, Zhi-Hua Zhou","In this work, we consider one challenging training time attack by modifying training data with bounded perturbation, hoping to manipulate the behavior (both targeted or non-targeted) of any corresponding trained classifier during test time when facing clean samples. To achieve this, we proposed to use an auto-encoder-like network to generate such adversarial perturbations on the training data together with one imaginary victim differentiable classifier. The perturbation generator will learn to update its weights so as to produce the most harmful noise, aiming to cause the lowest performance for the victim classifier during test time. This can be formulated into a non-linear equality constrained optimization problem. Unlike GANs, solving such problem is computationally challenging, we then proposed a simple yet effective procedure to decouple the alternating updates for the two networks for stability. By teaching the perturbation generator to hijacking the training trajectory of the victim classifier, the generator can thus learn to move against the victim classifier step by step. The method proposed in this paper can be easily extended to the label specific setting where the attacker can manipulate the predictions of the victim classifier according to some predefined rules rather than only making wrong predictions. Experiments on various datasets including CIFAR-10 and a reduced version of ImageNet confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method and empirical results showed that, such bounded perturbations have good transferability across different types of victim classifiers.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/1ce83e5d4135b07c0b82afffbe2b3436-Paper.pdf,2019,"classifier, victim, proposed, training, generator, perturbation, time, bounded, challenging, data","data, training, adversarial, fθ, gξ, classiﬁer, test, 10, figure, label","{'confuse': 0.4588181277297965, 'encoder': 0.4342434568665519, 'auto': 0.3828899232929743, 'generating': 0.3828899232929743, 'training': 0.2772510011267605, 'time': 0.27286774737843233, 'data': 0.2637265838115735, 'adversarial': 0.25685789132708753, 'learning': 0.14441795797413778}","{'victim': 0.5374786680078775, 'classifier': 0.35370557479322945, 'perturbation': 0.20785048709151613, 'generator': 0.18872002474390087, 'manipulate': 0.15803331597758996, 'targeted': 0.14845340168566948, 'proposed': 0.1353083002960531, 'perturbations': 0.12666758568518224, 'training': 0.12577862952797214, 'bounded': 0.11852964429148652}"

On two ways to use determinantal point processes for Monte Carlo integration,"Guillaume Gautier, Rémi Bardenet, Michal Valko","When approximating an integral by a weighted sum of function evaluations, determinantal point processes (DPPs) provide a way to enforce repulsion between the evaluation points.
This negative dependence is encoded by a kernel.
Fifteen years before the discovery of DPPs, Ermakov & Zolotukhin (EZ, 1960) had the intuition of sampling a DPP and solving a linear system to compute an unbiased Monte Carlo estimator of the integral.
In the absence of DPP machinery to derive an efficient sampler and analyze their estimator, the idea of Monte Carlo integration with DPPs was stored in the cellar of numerical integration. 
Recently, Bardenet & Hardy (BH, 2019) came up with a more natural estimator with a fast central limit theorem (CLT).
In this paper, we first take the EZ estimator out of the cellar, and analyze it using modern arguments.
Second, we provide an efficient implementation to sample exactly a particular multidimensional DPP called multivariate Jacobi ensemble.
The latter satisfies the assumptions of the aforementioned CLT. 
Third, our new implementation lets us investigate the behavior of the two unbiased Monte Carlo estimators in yet unexplored regimes.
We demonstrate experimentally good properties when the kernel is adapted to basis of functions in which the integrand is sparse or has fast-decaying coefficients.
If such a basis and the level of sparsity are known (e.g., we integrate a linear combination of kernel eigenfunctions), the EZ estimator can be the right choice, but otherwise it can display an erratic behavior.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/1d54c76f48f146c3b2d66daf9d7f845e-Paper.pdf,2019,"estimator, carlo, dpp, dpps, ez, kernel, monte, analyze, basis, behavior","x1, xn, dpp, dpps, kernel, kn, ez, jacobi, projection, estimator","{'integration': 0.4036256003555759, 'ways': 0.3820070860004517, 'use': 0.3666685059632476, 'determinantal': 0.3450499916081235, 'carlo': 0.3178138845806248, 'monte': 0.3178138845806248, 'two': 0.3080928972157953, 'point': 0.2711358028234671, 'processes': 0.2592382758331725}","{'ez': 0.28722001263218616, 'estimator': 0.2739023882150241, 'dpp': 0.25245505976919624, 'dpps': 0.25245505976919624, 'cellar': 0.19148000842145743, 'clt': 0.19148000842145743, 'carlo': 0.18322990237333614, 'monte': 0.18322990237333614, 'kernel': 0.15881298647518988, 'integral': 0.14836015209323658}"
ADDIS: an adaptive discarding algorithm for online FDR control with conservative nulls,"Jinjin Tian, Aaditya Ramdas","Major internet companies routinely perform tens of thousands of A/B tests each year. Such large-scale sequential experimentation has resulted in a recent spurt of new algorithms that can provably control the false discovery rate (FDR) in a fully online fashion. However, current state-of-the-art adaptive algorithms can suffer from a significant loss in power if null p-values are conservative (stochastically larger than the uniform distribution), a situation that occurs frequently in practice. In this work, we introduce a new adaptive discarding method called ADDIS that provably controls the FDR and achieves the best of both worlds: it enjoys appreciable power increase over all existing methods if nulls are conservative (the practical case), and rarely loses power if nulls are exactly uniformly distributed (the ideal case).

Controllable Text-to-Image Generation,"Bowen Li, Xiaojuan Qi, Thomas Lukasiewicz, Philip Torr","In this paper, we propose a novel controllable text-to-image generative adversarial network (ControlGAN), which can effectively synthesise high-quality images and also control parts of the image generation according to natural language descriptions.

Also, a word-level discriminator is proposed to provide fine-grained supervisory feedback by correlating words with image regions, facilitating training an effective generator which is able to manipulate specific visual attributes without affecting the generation of other content. Furthermore, perceptual loss is adopted to reduce the randomness involved in the image generation, and to encourage the generator to manipulate specific attributes required in the modified text.

Exploring Algorithmic Fairness in Robust Graph Covering Problems,"Aida Rahmattalabi, Phebe Vayanos, Anthony Fulginiti, Eric Rice, Bryan Wilder, Amulya Yadav, Milind Tambe","Fueled by algorithmic advances, AI algorithms are increasingly being deployed in settings subject to unanticipated challenges with complex social effects. Motivated by real-world deployment of AI driven, social-network based suicide prevention and landslide risk management interventions, this paper focuses on a robust graph covering problem subject to group fairness constraints. We show that, in the absence of fairness constraints, state-of-the-art algorithms for the robust graph covering problem result in biased node coverage: they tend to discriminate individuals (nodes) based on membership in traditionally marginalized groups. To remediate this issue, we propose a novel formulation of the robust covering problem with fairness constraints and a tractable approximation scheme applicable to real world instances. We provide a formal analysis of the price of group fairness (PoF) for this problem, where we show that uncertainty can lead to greater PoF.

Fast Convergence of Natural Gradient Descent for Over-Parameterized Neural Networks,"Guodong Zhang, James Martens, Roger B. Grosse","Natural gradient descent has proven very effective at mitigating the catastrophic effects of pathological curvature in the objective function, but little is known theoretically about its convergence properties, especially for \emph{non-linear} networks. In this work, we analyze for the first time the speed of convergence to global optimum for natural gradient descent on non-linear neural networks with the squared error loss. We identify two conditions which guarantee the global convergence: (1) the Jacobian matrix (of network's output for all training cases w.r.t the parameters) is full row rank and (2) the Jacobian matrix is stable for small perturbations around the initialization. For two-layer ReLU neural networks (i.e. with one hidden layer), we prove that these two conditions do hold throughout the training under the assumptions that the inputs do not degenerate and the network is over-parameterized. We further extend our analysis to more general loss function with similar convergence property.

Reducing the variance in online optimization by transporting past gradients,"Sébastien Arnold, Pierre-Antoine Manzagol, Reza Babanezhad Harikandeh, Ioannis Mitliagkas, Nicolas Le Roux","Most stochastic optimization methods use gradients once before discarding them. While variance reduction methods have shown that reusing past gradients can be beneficial when there is a finite number of datapoints, they do not easily extend to the online setting. One issue is the staleness due to using past gradients. We propose to correct this staleness using the idea of {\em implicit gradient transport} (IGT) which transforms gradients computed at previous iterates into gradients evaluated at the current iterate without using the Hessian explicitly. In addition to reducing the variance and bias of our updates over time, IGT can be used as a drop-in replacement for the gradient estimate in a number of well-understood methods such as heavy ball or Adam.

Neural networks grown and self-organized by noise,"Guruprasad Raghavan, Matt Thomson","Living neural networks emerge through a process of growth and self-organization that begins with a single cell and results in a brain, an organized and functional computational device. Artificial neural networks, however, rely on human-designed, hand-programmed architectures for their remarkable performance. Can we develop artificial computational devices that can grow and self-organize without human intervention? In this paper, we propose a biologically inspired developmental algorithm that can ‘grow’ a functional, layered neural network from a single initial cell. The algorithm organizes inter-layer connections to construct retinotopic pooling layers. Our approach is inspired by the mechanisms employed by the early visual system to wire the retina to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), days before animals open their eyes.  The key ingredients for robust self-organization are an emergent spontaneous spatiotemporal activity wave in the first layer and a local learning rule in the second layer that ‘learns’ the underlying activity pattern in the first layer.  The algorithm is adaptable to a wide-range of input-layer geometries, robust to malfunctioning units in the first layer, and so can be used to successfully grow and self-organize pooling architectures of different pool-sizes and shapes. The algorithm provides a primitive procedure for constructing layered neural networks through growth and self-organization. We also demonstrate that networks grown from a single unit perform as well as hand-crafted networks on MNIST.

One such challenging application is bacteria identification based on genomic sequences, which holds the promise of early detection of diseases, but requires a model that can output low confidence predictions on OOD genomic sequences from new bacteria that were not present in the training data. We introduce a genomics dataset for OOD detection that allows other researchers to benchmark progress on this important problem.

Root Mean Square Layer Normalization,"Biao Zhang, Rico Sennrich","Layer normalization (LayerNorm) has been successfully applied to various deep neural networks to help stabilize training and boost model convergence because of its capability in handling re-centering and re-scaling of both inputs and weight matrix. However, the computational overhead introduced by LayerNorm makes these improvements expensive and significantly slows the underlying network, e.g. RNN in particular. In this paper, we hypothesize that re-centering invariance in LayerNorm is dispensable and propose root mean square layer normalization, or RMSNorm. RMSNorm regularizes the summed inputs to a neuron in one layer according to root mean square (RMS), giving the model re-scaling invariance property and implicit learning rate adaptation ability. RMSNorm is computationally simpler and thus more efficient than LayerNorm.

HyperGCN: A New Method For Training Graph Convolutional Networks on Hypergraphs,"Naganand Yadati, Madhav Nimishakavi, Prateek Yadav, Vikram Nitin, Anand Louis, Partha Talukdar","In many real-world network datasets such as co-authorship, co-citation, email communication, etc., relationships are complex and go beyond pairwise. Hypergraphs provide a flexible and natural modeling tool to model such complex relationships. The obvious existence of such complex relationships in many real-world networks naturaly motivates the problem of learning with hypergraphs. A popular learning paradigm is hypergraph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) where the goal is to assign labels to initially unlabeled vertices in a hypergraph. Motivated by the fact that a graph convolutional network (GCN) has been effective for graph-based SSL, we propose HyperGCN, a novel GCN for SSL on attributed hypergraphs. Additionally, we show how HyperGCN can be used as a learning-based approach for combinatorial optimisation on NP-hard hypergraph problems. We demonstrate HyperGCN's effectiveness through detailed experimentation on real-world hypergraphs.

Asymptotics for Sketching in Least Squares Regression,"Edgar Dobriban, Sifan Liu","We consider a least squares regression problem where the data has been generated from a linear model, and we are interested to learn the unknown regression parameters. We consider ""sketch-and-solve""  methods that randomly project the data first, and do regression after. Previous works have analyzed the statistical and computational performance of such methods. However, the existing analysis is not fine-grained enough to show the fundamental differences between various methods, such as the Subsampled Randomized Hadamard Transform (SRHT) and Gaussian projections. In this paper, we make progress on this problem, working in an asymptotic framework where the number of datapoints and dimension of features goes to infinity. We find the limits of the accuracy loss (for estimation and test error) incurred by popular sketching methods.

TAB-VCR: Tags and Attributes based VCR Baselines,"Jingxiang Lin, Unnat Jain, Alexander Schwing","Reasoning is an important ability that we learn from a very early age. Yet, reasoning is extremely hard for algorithms. Despite impressive recent progress that has been reported on tasks that necessitate reasoning, such as visual question answering and visual dialog, models often exploit biases in datasets.  To develop models with better reasoning abilities, recently, the new visual commonsense reasoning(VCR) task has been introduced. Not only do models have to answer questions, but also do they have to provide a reason for the given answer.  The proposed baseline achieved compelling results, leveraging a meticulously designed model composed of LSTM modules and attention nets. Here we show that a much simpler model obtained by ablating and pruning the existing intricate baseline can perform better with half the number of trainable parameters. By associating visual features with attribute information and better text to image grounding, we obtain further improvements for our simpler & effective baseline, TAB-VCR. We show that this approach results in a 5.3%, 4.4% and 6.5% absolute improvement over the previous state-of-the-art on question answering, answer justification and holistic VCR.

Assessing Social and Intersectional Biases in Contextualized Word Representations,"Yi Chern Tan, L. Elisa Celis","Social bias in machine learning has drawn significant attention, with work ranging from demonstrations of bias in a multitude of applications, curating definitions of fairness for different contexts, to developing algorithms to mitigate bias. In natural language processing, gender bias has been shown to exist in context-free word embeddings. Recently, contextual word representations have outperformed word embeddings in several downstream NLP tasks. These word representations are conditioned on their context within a sentence, and can also be used to encode the entire sentence. In this paper, we analyze the extent to which state-of-the-art models for contextual word representations, such as BERT and GPT-2, encode biases with respect to gender, race, and intersectional identities. Towards this, we propose assessing bias at the contextual word level. This novel approach captures the contextual effects of bias missing in context-free word embeddings, yet avoids confounding effects that underestimate bias at the sentence encoding level. We demonstrate evidence of bias at the corpus level, find varying evidence of bias in embedding association tests, show in particular that racial bias is strongly encoded in contextual word models, and observe that bias effects for intersectional minorities are exacerbated beyond their constituent minority identities. Further, evaluating bias effects at the contextual word level captures biases that are not captured at the sentence level, confirming the need for our novel approach.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/201d546992726352471cfea6b0df0a48-Paper.pdf,2019,"bias, word, contextual, level, effects, sentence, context, embeddings, representations, approach","word, bias, tests, contextual, gender, names, test, sent, models, signiﬁcant","{'contextualized': 0.42384992354398304, 'intersectional': 0.42384992354398304, 'assessing': 0.38504103327835926, 'social': 0.38504103327835926, 'biases': 0.3725473611704543, 'word': 0.362339287778367, 'representations': 0.2722278351392144}","{'bias': 0.4858615750611484, 'word': 0.4531868928800725, 'contextual': 0.307294084216393, 'sentence': 0.24492997170657066, 'effects': 0.1900219535658459, 'level': 0.18470734200619726, 'intersectional': 0.1499189949236477, 'embeddings': 0.1382037142245381, 'identities': 0.12816220748815627, 'gender': 0.12246498585328533}"
Likelihood-Free Overcomplete ICA and Applications In Causal Discovery,"Chenwei DING, Mingming Gong, Kun Zhang, Dacheng Tao","Causal discovery witnessed significant progress over the past decades. In particular, many recent causal discovery methods make use of independent, non-Gaussian noise to achieve identifiability of the causal models. Existence of hidden direct common causes, or confounders, generally makes causal discovery more difficult; whenever they are present, the corresponding causal discovery algorithms can be seen as extensions of overcomplete independent component analysis (OICA). However, existing OICA algorithms usually make strong parametric assumptions on the distribution of independent components, which may be violated on real data, leading to sub-optimal or even wrong solutions. In addition, existing OICA algorithms rely on the Expectation Maximization (EM) procedure that requires computationally expensive inference of the posterior distribution of independent components. To tackle these problems, we present a Likelihood-Free Overcomplete ICA algorithm (LFOICA) that estimates the mixing matrix directly by back-propagation without any explicit assumptions on the density function of independent components. Thanks to its computational efficiency, the proposed method makes a number of causal discovery procedures much more practically feasible. For illustrative purposes, we demonstrate the computational efficiency and efficacy of our method in two causal discovery tasks on both synthetic and real data.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/20885c72ca35d75619d6a378edea9f76-Paper.pdf,2019,"causal, discovery, independent, algorithms, components, oica, assumptions, computational, data, distribution","causal, data, lfoica, xt, discovery, matrix, em, model, ng, oica","{'ica': 0.44261784154357425, 'overcomplete': 0.44261784154357425, 'likelihood': 0.3693705657081758, 'applications': 0.3546765671524745, 'discovery': 0.3546765671524745, 'free': 0.3485162870782498, 'causal': 0.31414923356599256}","{'discovery': 0.43529680067493376, 'causal': 0.4303080338408414, 'oica': 0.3000757327826181, 'independent': 0.2572503885564818, 'overcomplete': 0.18933562218510325, 'components': 0.18550380132754032, 'makes': 0.11199327911235066, 'assumptions': 0.10846456358268844, 'make': 0.10159489694098324, 'ica': 0.10002524426087271}"

High-Quality Self-Supervised Deep Image Denoising,"Samuli Laine, Tero Karras, Jaakko Lehtinen, Timo Aila","We describe a novel method for training high-quality image denoising models based on unorganized collections of corrupted images. The training does not need access to clean reference images, or explicit pairs of corrupted images, and can thus be applied in situations where such data is unacceptably expensive or impossible to acquire.

Generalization in multitask deep neural classifiers: a statistical physics approach,"Anthony Ndirango, Tyler Lee","A proper understanding of the striking generalization abilities of deep neural networks presents an enduring puzzle. Recently, there has been a growing body of numerically-grounded theoretical work that has contributed important insights to the theory of learning in deep neural nets. There has also been a recent interest in extending these analyses to understanding how multitask learning can further improve the generalization capacity of deep neural nets. These studies deal almost exclusively with regression tasks which are amenable to existing analytical techniques. We develop an analytic theory of the nonlinear dynamics of generalization of deep neural networks trained to solve classification tasks using softmax outputs and cross-entropy loss, addressing both single task and multitask settings. We do so by adapting techniques from the statistical physics of disordered systems, accounting for both finite size datasets and correlated outputs induced by the training dynamics. We discuss the validity of our theoretical results in comparison to a comprehensive suite of numerical experiments. Our analysis provides theoretical support for the intuition that the performance of multitask learning is determined by the noisiness of the tasks and how well their input features align with each other. Highly related, clean tasks benefit each other, whereas unrelated, clean tasks can be detrimental to individual task performance.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/216f44e2d28d4e175a194492bde9148f-Paper.pdf,2019,"tasks, deep, neural, generalization, learning, multitask, theoretical, clean, dynamics, nets","task, multitask, data, learning, tasks, student, sa, training, auxiliary, networks","{'multitask': 0.477532952967011, 'physics': 0.4338086936467355, 'classifiers': 0.3760083668231229, 'statistical': 0.3760083668231229, 'approach': 0.3355197281157463, 'generalization': 0.3110591790306373, 'deep': 0.2241764110172006, 'neural': 0.20352235315685538}","{'multitask': 0.34269451489343006, 'tasks': 0.2145386068532459, 'clean': 0.1919658478732489, 'outputs': 0.1784958312794076, 'deep': 0.17300560273908905, 'generalization': 0.17197651420070706, 'nets': 0.17182932029308676, 'neural': 0.15245996053874508, 'theoretical': 0.14875840443353616, 'understanding': 0.12894134301226895}"
Causal Regularization,Dominik Janzing,"We argue that regularizing terms in standard regression methods not only help against overfitting finite data, but sometimes also help in getting better causal models. We first consider a multi-dimensional variable linearly influencing a target variable with some multi-dimensional unobserved common cause, where the confounding effect can be decreased by keeping the penalizing term in Ridge and Lasso regression even in the population limit. The reason is a close analogy between overfitting and confounding observed for our toy model. In the case of overfitting, we can choose regularization constants via cross validation, but here we choose the regularization constant by first estimating the strength of confounding, which yielded reasonable results for simulated and real data. Further, we show a ‘causal generalization bound’ which states (subject to our particular model of confounding) that the error made by interpreting any non-linear regression as causal model can be bounded from above whenever functions are taken from a not too rich class.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/2172fde49301047270b2897085e4319d-Paper.pdf,2019,"confounding, causal, model, overfitting, regression, choose, data, dimensional, first, help","causal, confounding, scenario, regression, vector, model, regularization, σxx, distribution, xa","{'causal': 0.7106734372809693, 'regularization': 0.7035220433954092}","{'confounding': 0.4626070261357661, 'overfitting': 0.29713183608157706, 'causal': 0.24259167850981964, 'regression': 0.196242009307799, 'choose': 0.19551173903939686, 'help': 0.16466718140938244, 'variable': 0.15267978824714254, 'regularization': 0.14732118077855008, 'analogy': 0.12453045238441805, 'decreased': 0.12453045238441805}"

A popular and effective technique in computing nearest neighbors approximately is the locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) scheme. In this paper, we aim to develop LSH schemes for distance functions that measure the distance between two probability distributions, particularly for f-divergences as well as a generalization to capture mutual information loss. First, we provide a general framework to design LHS schemes for f-divergence distance functions and develop LSH schemes for the generalized Jensen-Shannon divergence and triangular discrimination in this framework. We show a two-sided approximation result for approximation of the generalized Jensen-Shannon divergence by the Hellinger distance, which may be of independent interest. Next, we show a general method of reducing the problem of designing an LSH scheme for a Krein kernel (which can be expressed as the difference of two positive definite kernels) to the problem of maximum inner product search.

Multi-Criteria Dimensionality Reduction with Applications to Fairness,"Uthaipon Tantipongpipat, Samira Samadi, Mohit Singh, Jamie H. Morgenstern, Santosh Vempala","Dimensionality reduction is a classical technique widely used for data analysis. One foundational instantiation is Principal Component Analysis (PCA),
which minimizes the average reconstruction error. In this paper, we introduce the multi-criteria dimensionality reduction problem where we are given multiple objectives that need to be optimized simultaneously. As an application, our model captures several fairness criteria for dimensionality reduction such as the Fair-PCA problem introduced by Samadi et al. [NeurIPS18] and the Nash Social Welfare (NSW) problem. In the Fair-PCA problem, the input data is divided into k groups, and the goal is to find a single d-dimensional representation for all groups for which the maximum reconstruction error of any one group is minimized. In NSW the goal is to maximize the product of the  individual variances of the groups achieved by the common low-dimensinal space.Our main result is an exact polynomial-time algorithm for the two-criteria dimensionality reduction problem when the two criteria are increasing concave functions. As an application of this result, we obtain a polynomial time algorithm for Fair-PCA for k=2 groups, resolving an open problem of Samadi et al.[NeurIPS18], and a polynomial time algorithm for NSW objective for k=2 groups.  We also give approximation algorithms for k>2. Our technical contribution in the above results is to prove new low-rank properties of extreme point solutions to semi-definite programs.

In this paper, we prove that a variant of PPO and TRPO equipped with overparametrized neural networks converges to the globally optimal policy at a sublinear rate. The key to our analysis is the global convergence of infinite-dimensional mirror descent under a notion of one-point monotonicity, where the gradient and iterate are instantiated by neural networks.

Learning Neural Networks with Adaptive Regularization,"Han Zhao, Yao-Hung Hubert Tsai, Russ R. Salakhutdinov, Geoffrey J. Gordon","Feed-forward neural networks can be understood as a combination of an intermediate representation and a linear hypothesis. While most previous works aim to diversify the representations, we explore the complementary direction by performing an adaptive and data-dependent regularization motivated by the empirical Bayes method. Specifically, we propose to construct a matrix-variate normal prior (on weights) whose covariance matrix has a Kronecker product structure. This structure is designed to capture the correlations in neurons through backpropagation. Under the assumption of this Kronecker factorization, the prior encourages neurons to borrow statistical strength from one another. Hence, it leads to an adaptive and data-dependent regularization when training networks on small datasets. To optimize the model, we present an efficient block coordinate descent algorithm with analytical solutions. Empirically, we demonstrate that the proposed method helps networks converge to local optima with smaller stable ranks and spectral norms.

Turbo Autoencoder: Deep learning based channel codes for point-to-point communication channels,"Yihan Jiang, Hyeji Kim, Himanshu Asnani, Sreeram Kannan, Sewoong Oh, Pramod Viswanath","Designing codes that combat the noise in a communication medium has remained a significant area of research in information theory as well as wireless communications. Asymptotically optimal channel codes have been developed by mathematicians for communicating under canonical models after over 60 years of research. On the other hand, in many non-canonical channel settings, optimal codes do not exist and the codes designed for canonical models are adapted via heuristics to these channels and are thus not guaranteed to be optimal. In this work, we make significant progress on this problem by designing a fully end-to-end jointly trained neural encoder and decoder, namely, Turbo Autoencoder (TurboAE), with the following contributions: (a) under moderate block lengths, TurboAE approaches state-of-the-art performance under canonical channels; (b) moreover, TurboAE outperforms the state-of-the-art codes under non-canonical settings in terms of reliability.

DetNAS: Backbone Search for Object Detection,"Yukang Chen, Tong Yang, Xiangyu Zhang, GAOFENG MENG, Xinyu Xiao, Jian Sun","Object detectors are usually equipped with backbone networks designed for image classification.  It might be sub-optimal because of the gap between the tasks of image classification and object detection. In this work, we present DetNAS to use Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for the design of better backbones for object detection.  It is non-trivial because detection training typically needs ImageNetpre-training while NAS systems require accuracies on the target detection task as supervisory signals. Based on the technique of one-shot supernet, which contains all possible networks in the search space, we propose a framework for backbone search on object detection. We train the supernet under the typical detector training schedule: ImageNet pre-training and detection fine-tuning. Then, the architecture search is performed on the trained supernet, using the detection task as the guidance. This framework makes NAS on backbones very efficient. In experiments, we show the effectiveness of DetNAS on various detectors, for instance, one-stage RetinaNetand the two-stage FPN. We empirically find that networks searched on object detection shows consistent superiority compared to those searched on ImageNet classification.

Nonlinear scaling of resource allocation in sensory bottlenecks,"Laura Rose Edmondson, Alejandro Jimenez Rodriguez, Hannes P. Saal","In many sensory systems, information transmission is constrained by a bottleneck,
where the number of output neurons is vastly smaller than the number of input
neurons. Efficient coding theory predicts that in these scenarios the brain should
allocate its limited resources by removing redundant information. Previous work
has typically assumed that receptors are uniformly distributed across the sensory
sheet, when in reality these vary in density, often by an order of magnitude. How,
then, should the brain efficiently allocate output neurons when the density of input
neurons is nonuniform? Here, we show analytically and numerically that resource
allocation scales nonlinearly in efficient coding models that maximize information
transfer, when inputs arise from separate regions with different receptor densities.
Importantly, the proportion of output neurons allocated to a given input region
changes depending on the width of the bottleneck, and thus cannot be predicted
from input density or region size alone. Narrow bottlenecks favor magnification of
high density input regions, while wider bottlenecks often cause contraction. Our
results demonstrate that both expansion and contraction of sensory input regions
can arise in efficient coding models and that the final allocation crucially depends
on the neural resources made available.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/2297607a5db8576d5ad6bbd83696ff60-Paper.pdf,2019,"input, neurons, density, coding, efficient, information, output, regions, sensory, allocate","density, bottleneck, region, sensory, input, allocation, neurons, regions, different, output","{'bottlenecks': 0.44151310813804434, 'sensory': 0.44151310813804434, 'scaling': 0.4178653081524904, 'allocation': 0.38807260358494605, 'nonlinear': 0.3774391270615652, 'resource': 0.3774391270615652}","{'neurons': 0.3313100820866876, 'input': 0.2756684613676618, 'density': 0.24587678083950398, 'coding': 0.24029259628152042, 'sensory': 0.22971603323282053, 'regions': 0.19095913222812982, 'allocate': 0.17882340107164443, 'bottlenecks': 0.17392350754769917, 'contraction': 0.17392350754769917, 'allocation': 0.16019506418768029}"

Diffusion Improves Graph Learning,"Johannes Gasteiger, Stefan Weißenberger, Stephan Günnemann","Graph convolution is the core of most Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and usually approximated by message passing between direct (one-hop) neighbors. In this work, we remove the restriction of using only the direct neighbors by introducing a powerful, yet spatially localized graph convolution: Graph diffusion convolution (GDC). GDC leverages generalized graph diffusion, examples of which are the heat kernel and personalized PageRank. It alleviates the problem of noisy and often arbitrarily defined edges in real graphs. We show that GDC is closely related to spectral-based models and thus combines the strengths of both spatial (message passing) and spectral methods. We demonstrate that replacing message passing with graph diffusion convolution consistently leads to significant performance improvements across a wide range of models on both supervised and unsupervised tasks and a variety of datasets. Furthermore, GDC is not limited to GNNs but can trivially be combined with any graph-based model or algorithm (e.g. spectral clustering) without requiring any changes to the latter or affecting its computational complexity.

"Inverting Deep Generative models, One layer at a time","Qi Lei, Ajil Jalal, Inderjit S. Dhillon, Alexandros G. Dimakis","We study the problem of inverting a deep generative model with ReLU activations. 
Inversion corresponds to finding a latent code vector that explains observed measurements as much as possible. 
In most prior works this is performed by attempting to solve a non-convex optimization problem involving the generator. 
In this paper we obtain several novel theoretical results for the inversion problem.We show that for the realizable case, single layer inversion can be performed exactly in polynomial time, by solving a linear program. Further, we show that for two layers, inversion is NP-hard to recover binary latent code (even for the realizable case) and the pre-image set can be non-convex.For generative models of arbitrary depth, we show that exact recovery is possible in polynomial time 
with high probability, if the layers are expanding and the weights are randomly selected. 
Very recent work analyzed the same problem for gradient descent inversion. Their analysis requires significantly higher expansion (logarithmic in the latent dimension) while our proposed algorithm can provably reconstruct even with constant factor expansion.

This problem has been extensively studied in the convex-concave regime for which a global equilibrium solution can be computed efficiently. In this paper, we study the problem in the non-convex regime and show that an $\varepsilon$--first order stationary point of the game can be computed when one of the player’s objective can be optimized to global optimality efficiently. In particular, we first consider the case where the objective of one of the players satisfies the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) condition. For such a game, we show that a simple multi-step gradient descent-ascent algorithm finds an $\varepsilon$--first order stationary point of the problem in $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ iterations. Then we show that our framework can also be applied to the case where the objective of the ``max-player"" is concave. In this case, we propose a multi-step gradient descent-ascent algorithm that finds an $\varepsilon$--first order stationary point of the game in $\widetilde{\cal O}(\varepsilon^{-3.5})$ iterations, which is the best known rate in the literature.

The Option Keyboard: Combining Skills in Reinforcement Learning,"Andre Barreto, Diana Borsa, Shaobo Hou, Gheorghe Comanici, Eser Aygün, Philippe Hamel, Daniel Toyama, Jonathan hunt, Shibl Mourad, David Silver, Doina Precup","The ability to combine known skills to create new ones may be crucial in the solution of complex reinforcement learning problems that unfold over extended periods. We argue that a robust way of combining skills is to define and manipulate them in the space of pseudo-rewards (or ""cumulants""). Based on this premise, we propose a framework for combining skills using the formalism of options. We show that every deterministic option can be unambiguously represented as a cumulant defined in an extended domain. Building on this insight and on previous results on transfer learning, we show how to approximate options whose cumulants are linear combinations of the cumulants of known options. This means that, once we have learned options associated with a set of cumulants, we can instantaneously synthesise options induced by any linear combination of them, without any learning involved. We describe how this framework provides a hierarchical interface to the environment whose abstract actions correspond to combinations of basic skills.

On Learning Over-parameterized Neural Networks: A Functional Approximation Perspective,"Lili Su, Pengkun Yang","We consider training over-parameterized two-layer neural networks with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) using gradient descent (GD) method. Inspired by a recent line of work, we study the evolutions of network prediction errors across GD iterations, which can be  neatly described in a matrix form. When the network is sufficiently over-parameterized, these matrices individually approximate {\em an} integral operator which is determined by the feature vector distribution $\rho$ only. Consequently, GD method can be viewed as {\em approximately} applying the powers of this integral operator on the underlying/target function $f^*$ that generates the responses/labels. 
 
We show that if $f^*$ admits a low-rank approximation with respect to the eigenspaces of this integral operator, then the empirical risk decreases to this low rank approximation error at a linear rate which is determined by $f^*$ and $\rho$ only, i.e., the rate is independent of the sample size $n$. Furthermore, if $f^*$ has zero low-rank approximation error, then, as long as the width of the neural network is $\Omega(n\log n)$, the empirical risk decreases to $\Theta(1/\sqrt{n})$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result showing the sufficiency of nearly-linear network over-parameterization.  We provide an application of our general results to the setting where $\rho$ is the uniform distribution on the spheres and $f^*$ is a polynomial. Throughout this paper, we consider the scenario where the input dimension $d$ is fixed.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/253f7b5d921338af34da817c00f42753-Paper.pdf,2019,"network, approximation, gd, integral, linear, low, operator, rank, rho, consider","log, theorem, convergence, neural, network, function, rate, training, 19, pn","{'parameterized': 0.49394610441703507, 'functional': 0.46605842021585897, 'perspective': 0.458606312237125, 'approximation': 0.40804785704485536, 'networks': 0.25226381846848067, 'neural': 0.25226381846848067, 'learning': 0.1863059939934893}","{'rho': 0.3259544272287062, 'gd': 0.31286650751791156, 'integral': 0.2668443435416224, 'operator': 0.23135150773201665, 'rank': 0.19887913938900414, 'decreases': 0.17525720948727544, 'approximation': 0.16126990395676832, 'low': 0.155194975023429, 'determined': 0.15423433848801107, 'network': 0.14966269683759748}"

"Painless Stochastic Gradient: Interpolation, Line-Search, and Convergence Rates","Sharan Vaswani, Aaron Mishkin, Issam Laradji, Mark Schmidt, Gauthier Gidel, Simon Lacoste-Julien","Recent works have shown that stochastic gradient descent (SGD) achieves the fast convergence rates of full-batch gradient descent for over-parameterized models satisfying certain interpolation conditions. However, the step-size used in these works depends on unknown quantities and SGD's practical performance heavily relies on the choice of this step-size. We propose to use line-search techniques to automatically set the step-size when training models that can interpolate the data. In the interpolation setting, we prove that SGD with a stochastic variant of the classic Armijo line-search attains the deterministic convergence rates for both convex and strongly-convex functions. Under additional assumptions, SGD with Armijo line-search is shown to achieve fast convergence for non-convex functions. Furthermore, we show that stochastic extra-gradient with a Lipschitz line-search attains linear convergence for an important class of non-convex functions and saddle-point problems satisfying interpolation. To improve the proposed methods' practical performance, we give heuristics to use larger step-sizes and acceleration. We compare the proposed algorithms against numerous optimization methods on standard classification tasks using both kernel methods and deep networks. The proposed methods result in competitive performance across all models and datasets, while being robust to the precise choices of hyper-parameters.

Tight Regret Bounds for Model-Based Reinforcement Learning with Greedy Policies,"Yonathan Efroni, Nadav Merlis, Mohammad Ghavamzadeh, Shie Mannor","State-of-the-art efficient model-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms typically act by iteratively solving empirical models, i.e., by  performing full-planning on Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) built by the gathered experience. In this paper, we focus on model-based RL in the finite-state finite-horizon MDP setting and establish that exploring with greedy policies -- act by 1-step planning -- can achieve  tight minimax performance in terms of regret, O(\sqrt{HSAT}). Thus, full-planning in model-based RL can be avoided altogether without any performance degradation, and, by doing so, the computational complexity decreases by a factor of S. The results are based on a novel analysis of real-time dynamic programming, then extended to model-based RL. Specifically, we generalize existing algorithms that perform full-planning to such that act by 1-step planning.

Better Transfer Learning with Inferred Successor Maps,"Tamas Madarasz, Tim Behrens","Humans and animals show remarkable flexibility in adjusting their behaviour when their goals, or rewards in the environment change. While such flexibility is a hallmark of intelligent behaviour, these multi-task scenarios remain an important challenge for machine learning algorithms and neurobiological models alike. We investigated two approaches that could enable this flexibility: factorized representations, which abstract away general aspects of a task from those prone to change, and nonparametric, memory-based approaches, which can provide a principled way of using similarity to past experiences to guide current behaviour. In particular, we combine the successor representation (SR), that factors the value of actions into expected outcomes and corresponding rewards, with evaluating  task similarity through clustering the space of rewards. The proposed algorithm inverts a generative model over tasks, and dynamically samples from a flexible number of distinct SR maps while accumulating evidence about the current task context through amortized inference.

Random Quadratic Forms with Dependence: Applications to Restricted Isometry and Beyond,"Arindam Banerjee, Qilong Gu, Vidyashankar Sivakumar, Steven Z. Wu","Several important families of computational and statistical results in machine learning and randomized algorithms rely on uniform bounds on quadratic forms of random vectors or matrices. Such results include the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (J-L) Lemma, the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), randomized sketching algorithms, and approximate linear algebra. The existing results critically depend on statistical independence, e.g., independent entries for random vectors, independent rows for random matrices, etc., which prevent their usage in dependent or adaptive modeling settings. In this paper, we show that such independence is in fact not needed for such results which continue to hold under fairly general dependence structures. In particular, we present uniform bounds on random quadratic forms of stochastic processes which are conditionally independent and sub-Gaussian given another (latent) process. Our setup allows general dependencies of the stochastic process on the history of the latent process and the latent process to be influenced by realizations of the stochastic process. The results are thus applicable to adaptive modeling settings and also allows for sequential design of random vectors and matrices. We also discuss stochastic process based forms of  J-L, RIP, and sketching, to illustrate the generality of the results.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/2751fae77b24c37382cf6464173d145e-Paper.pdf,2019,"process, results, random, stochastic, forms, independent, latent, matrices, vectors, adaptive","random, f1, results, stochastic, process, sp, fi, gaussian, ξi, matrices","{'forms': 0.4106337919346809, 'restricted': 0.4106337919346809, 'isometry': 0.3886399131573723, 'dependence': 0.3609309028855066, 'applications': 0.32904725026963944, 'quadratic': 0.318162153471186, 'beyond': 0.29783743960340825, 'random': 0.2885156665504086}","{'process': 0.29273208729466665, 'random': 0.2627859862677584, 'forms': 0.23605930271959122, 'rip': 0.22616408340073654, 'vectors': 0.21361782559715983, 'matrices': 0.2061315527924357, 'results': 0.1981867042411075, 'stochastic': 0.18865777587964436, 'sketching': 0.17808108760911884, 'independent': 0.17449834417985674}"
Energy-Inspired Models: Learning with Sampler-Induced Distributions,"John Lawson, George Tucker, Bo Dai, Rajesh Ranganath","Energy-based models (EBMs) are powerful probabilistic models, but suffer from intractable sampling and density evaluation due to the partition function. As a result, inference in EBMs relies on approximate sampling algorithms, leading to a mismatch between the model and inference. Motivated by this, we consider the sampler-induced distribution as the model of interest and maximize the likelihood of this model. This yields a class of energy-inspired models (EIMs) that incorporate learned energy functions while still providing exact samples and tractable log-likelihood lower bounds. We describe and evaluate three instantiations of such models based on truncated rejection sampling, self-normalized importance sampling, and Hamiltonian importance sampling. These models out-perform or perform comparably to the recently proposed Learned Accept/RejectSampling algorithm and provide new insights on ranking Noise Contrastive Estimation and Contrastive Predictive Coding. Moreover, EIMs allow us to generalize a recent connection between multi-sample variational lower bounds and auxiliary variable variational inference.

However, the phenomenon seldom occurs in the context of recent deep learning. There is a gap between theory and reality.

Detecting Overfitting via Adversarial Examples,"Roman Werpachowski, András György, Csaba Szepesvari","The repeated community-wide reuse of test sets in popular benchmark problems raises doubts about the credibility of  reported test-error rates. Verifying whether a learned model is overfitted to a test set is challenging as independent test sets drawn from the same data distribution are usually unavailable, while other test sets may introduce a distribution shift. We propose a new hypothesis test that uses only the original test data to detect overfitting. It utilizes a new unbiased error estimate that is based on adversarial examples generated from the test data and importance weighting. Overfitting is detected if this error estimate is sufficiently different from the original test error rate. We develop a specialized variant of our test for multiclass image classification, and apply it to testing overfitting of recent models to the popular ImageNet benchmark.

Region-specific Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping,"Zhengyang Shen, Francois-Xavier Vialard, Marc Niethammer","We introduce a region-specific diffeomorphic metric mapping (RDMM) registration approach. RDMM is non-parametric, estimating spatio-temporal velocity fields which parameterize the sought-for spatial transformation. Regularization of these velocity fields is necessary. In contrast to existing non-parametric registration approaches using a fixed spatially-invariant regularization, for example, the large displacement diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) model, our approach allows for spatially-varying regularization which is advected via the estimated spatio-temporal velocity field. Hence, not only can our model capture large displacements, it does so with a spatio-temporal regularizer that keeps track of how regions deform, which is a more natural mathematical formulation. We explore a family of RDMM registration approaches: 1) a registration model where regions with separate regularizations are pre-defined (e.g., in an atlas space or for distinct foreground and background regions), 2) a registration model where a general spatially-varying regularizer is estimated, and 3) a registration model where the spatially-varying regularizer is obtained via an end-to-end trained deep learning (DL) model. We provide a variational derivation of RDMM, showing that the model can assure diffeomorphic transformations in the continuum, and that LDDMM is a particular instance of RDMM. To evaluate RDMM performance we experiment 1) on synthetic 2D data and 2) on two 3D datasets: knee magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) and computed tomography images (CT) of the lung. Results show that our framework achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art image registration approaches, while providing additional information via a learned spatio-temporal regularizer. Further, our deep learning approach allows for very fast RDMM and LDDMM estimations.

Our framework is both generic, allowing the design of teaching schedules for different memory models, and also interactive, allowing the teacher to adapt the schedule to the underlying forgetting mechanisms of the learner. Furthermore, for a well-known memory model, we are able to identify a regime of model parameters where our framework is guaranteed to achieve high performance.

Further, we introduce two complementary losses which explicitly regularize the semantic structure of the feature space.

Unconstrained Monotonic Neural Networks,"Antoine Wehenkel, Gilles Louppe","Monotonic neural networks have recently been proposed as a way to define invertible transformations. These transformations can be combined into powerful autoregressive flows that have been shown to be universal approximators of continuous probability distributions. Architectures that ensure monotonicity typically enforce constraints on weights and activation functions, which enables invertibility but leads to a cap on the expressiveness of the resulting transformations.  In this work, we propose the Unconstrained Monotonic Neural Network (UMNN) architecture based on the insight that a function is monotonic as long as its derivative is strictly positive. In particular, this latter condition can be enforced with a free-form neural network whose only constraint is the positiveness of its output.

Efficient Identification in Linear Structural Causal Models with Instrumental Cutsets,"Daniel Kumor, Bryant Chen, Elias Bareinboim","One of the most common mistakes made when performing data analysis is attributing causal meaning to regression coefficients. Formally, a causal effect can only be computed if it is identifiable from a combination of observational data and structural knowledge about the domain under investigation (Pearl, 2000, Ch. 5). Building on the literature of instrumental variables (IVs), a plethora of methods has been developed to identify causal effects in linear systems. Almost invariably, however, the most powerful such methods rely on exponential-time procedures. In this paper, we investigate graphical conditions to allow efficient identification in arbitrary linear structural causal models (SCMs). In particular, we develop a method to efficiently find unconditioned instrumental subsets, which are generalizations of IVs that can be used to tame the complexity of many canonical algorithms found in the literature. Further, we prove that determining whether an effect can be identified with TSID (Weihs et al., 2017), a method more powerful than unconditioned instrumental sets and other efficient identification algorithms, is NP-Complete.

Feed-forward convolutional models capture only feature interactions within finite receptive fields while recurrent architectures can be slow and difficult to train due to vanishing gradients.

Convolution with even-sized kernels and symmetric padding,"Shuang Wu, Guanrui Wang, Pei Tang, Feng Chen, Luping Shi","Compact convolutional neural networks gain efficiency mainly through depthwise convolutions, expanded channels and complex topologies, which contrarily aggravate the training process. Besides, 3x3 kernels dominate the spatial representation in these models, whereas even-sized kernels (2x2, 4x4) are rarely adopted. In this work, we quantify the shift problem occurs in even-sized kernel convolutions by an information erosion hypothesis, and eliminate it by proposing symmetric padding on four sides of the feature maps (C2sp, C4sp). Symmetric padding releases the generalization capabilities of even-sized kernels at little computational cost, making them outperform 3x3 kernels in image classification and generation tasks. Moreover, C2sp obtains comparable accuracy to emerging compact models with much less memory and time consumption during training.

Inducing brain-relevant bias in natural language processing models,"Dan Schwartz, Mariya Toneva, Leila Wehbe","Progress in natural language processing (NLP) models that estimate representations of word sequences has recently been leveraged to improve the understanding of language processing in the brain.  However, these models have not been specifically designed to capture the way the brain represents language meaning. We hypothesize that fine-tuning these models to predict recordings of brain activity of people reading text will lead to representations that encode more brain-activity-relevant language information. We demonstrate that a version of BERT, a recently introduced and powerful language model, can improve the prediction of brain activity after fine-tuning. We show that the relationship between language and brain activity learned by BERT during this fine-tuning transfers across multiple participants. We also show that, for some participants, the fine-tuned representations learned from both magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are better for predicting fMRI than the representations learned from fMRI alone, indicating that the learned representations capture brain-activity-relevant information that is not simply an artifact of the modality.

SMILe: Scalable Meta Inverse Reinforcement Learning through Context-Conditional Policies,"Seyed Kamyar Seyed Ghasemipour, Shixiang (Shane) Gu, Richard Zemel","Imitation Learning (IL) has been successfully applied to complex sequential decision-making problems where standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms fail. A number of recent methods extend IL to few-shot learning scenarios, where a meta-trained policy learns to quickly master new tasks using limited demonstrations. However, although Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) often outperforms Behavioral Cloning (BC) in terms of imitation quality, most of these approaches build on BC due to its simple optimization objective.

After generating synthesized examples, we then update the model parameters according to the maximum likelihood learning gradient, as if the synthesized examples are fair samples from the current model.  We treat this non-convergent short-run MCMC as a learned generator model or a flow model. We provide arguments for treating the learned non-convergent short-run MCMC as a valid model. We show that the learned short-run MCMC is capable of generating realistic images.

Uncertainty-based Continual Learning with Adaptive Regularization,"Hongjoon Ahn, Sungmin Cha, Donggyu Lee, Taesup Moon","We introduce a new neural network-based continual learning algorithm, dubbed as Uncertainty-regularized Continual Learning (UCL), which builds on traditional Bayesian online learning framework with variational inference. We focus on two significant drawbacks of the recently proposed regularization-based methods: a) considerable additional memory cost for determining the per-weight regularization strengths and b) the absence of gracefully forgetting scheme, which can prevent performance degradation in learning new tasks. In this paper, we show UCL can solve these two problems by introducing a fresh interpretation on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence term of the variational lower bound for Gaussian mean-field approximation. Based on the interpretation, we propose the notion of node-wise uncertainty, which drastically reduces the number of additional parameters for implementing per-weight regularization. Moreover, we devise two additional regularization terms that enforce \emph{stability} by freezing important parameters for past tasks and allow \emph{plasticity} by controlling the actively learning parameters for a new task. Through extensive experiments, we show UCL convincingly outperforms most of recent state-of-the-art baselines not only on popular supervised learning benchmarks, but also on challenging lifelong reinforcement learning tasks.

Implicit Posterior Variational Inference for Deep Gaussian Processes,"Haibin YU, Yizhou Chen, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low, Patrick Jaillet, Zhongxiang Dai","A multi-layer deep Gaussian process (DGP) model is a hierarchical composition of GP models with a greater expressive power. Exact DGP inference is intractable, which has motivated the recent development of deterministic and stochastic approximation methods. Unfortunately, the deterministic approximation methods yield a biased posterior belief while the stochastic one is computationally costly. This paper presents an implicit posterior variational inference (IPVI) framework for DGPs that can ideally recover an unbiased posterior belief and still preserve time efficiency.

Are Sixteen Heads Really Better than One?,"Paul Michel, Omer Levy, Graham Neubig","Multi-headed attention is a driving force behind recent state-of-the-art NLP models.

Model Compression with Adversarial Robustness: A Unified Optimization Framework,"Shupeng Gui, Haotao Wang, Haichuan Yang, Chen Yu, Zhangyang Wang, Ji Liu","Deep model compression has been extensively studied, and state-of-the-art methods can now achieve high compression ratios with minimal accuracy loss. This paper studies model compression through a different lens: could we compress models without hurting their robustness to adversarial attacks, in addition to maintaining accuracy? Previous literature suggested that the goals of robustness and compactness might sometimes contradict. We propose a novel Adversarially Trained Model Compression (ATMC) framework. ATMC constructs a unified constrained optimization formulation, where existing compression means (pruning, factorization, quantization) are all integrated into the constraints. An efficient algorithm is then developed. An extensive group of experiments are presented, demonstrating that ATMC obtains remarkably more favorable trade-off among model size, accuracy and robustness, over currently available alternatives in various settings.

Subspace Attack: Exploiting Promising Subspaces for Query-Efficient Black-box Attacks,"Yiwen Guo, Ziang Yan, Changshui Zhang","Unlike the white-box counterparts that are widely studied and readily accessible, adversarial examples in black-box settings are generally more Herculean on account of the difficulty of estimating gradients. Many methods achieve the task by issuing numerous queries to target classification systems, which makes the whole procedure costly and suspicious to the systems. In this paper, we aim at reducing the query complexity of black-box attacks in this category. We propose to exploit gradients of a few reference models which arguably span some promising search subspaces. Experimental results show that, in comparison with the state-of-the-arts, our method can gain up to 2x and 4x reductions in the requisite mean and medium numbers of queries with much lower failure rates even if the reference models are trained on a small and inadequate dataset disjoint to the one for training the victim model.

Combinatorial Bayesian Optimization using the Graph Cartesian Product,"Changyong Oh, Jakub Tomczak, Efstratios Gavves, Max Welling","This paper focuses on Bayesian Optimization (BO) for objectives on combinatorial
search spaces, including ordinal and categorical variables. Despite the abundance
of potential applications of Combinatorial BO, including chipset configuration
search and neural architecture search, only a handful of methods have been pro-
posed. We introduce COMBO, a new Gaussian Process (GP) BO. COMBO
quantifies “smoothness” of functions on combinatorial search spaces by utilizing
a combinatorial graph. The vertex set of the combinatorial graph consists of all
possible joint assignments of the variables, while edges are constructed using the
graph Cartesian product of the sub-graphs that represent the individual variables.
On this combinatorial graph, we propose an ARD diffusion kernel with which the
GP is able to model high-order interactions between variables leading to better
performance. Moreover, using the Horseshoe prior for the scale parameter in the
ARD diffusion kernel results in an effective variable selection procedure, making
COMBO suitable for high dimensional problems. Computationally, in COMBO
the graph Cartesian product allows the Graph Fourier Transform calculation to
scale linearly instead of exponentially.We validate COMBO in a wide array of real-
istic benchmarks, including weighted maximum satisfiability problems and neural
architecture search. COMBO outperforms consistently the latest state-of-the-art

The SA-MCMC proposal distribution automatically adapts within its parametric family to best approximate the target distribution, so in contrast to many existing MCMC methods, SA-MCMC does not require any tuning of the proposal distribution. Instead, SA-MCMC only requires specifying the initial state of N points, which can often be chosen a priori, thereby automating the entire sampling procedure with no tuning required.

Integrating Markov processes with structural causal modeling enables counterfactual inference in complex systems,"Robert Ness, Kaushal Paneri, Olga Vitek","This manuscript contributes a general and practical framework for casting a Markov process model of a system at equilibrium as a structural causal model, and carrying out counterfactual inference. Markov processes mathematically describe the mechanisms in the system, and predict the system’s equilibrium behavior upon intervention, but do not support counterfactual inference. In contrast, structural causal models support counterfactual inference, but do not identify the mechanisms. This manuscript leverages the benefits of both approaches. We define the structural causal models in terms of the parameters and the equilibrium dynamics of the Markov process models, and counterfactual inference flows from these settings. The proposed approach alleviates the identifiability drawback of the structural causal models, in that the counterfactual inference is consistent with the counterfactual trajectories simulated from the Markov process model. We showcase the benefits of this framework in case studies of complex biomolecular systems with nonlinear dynamics. We illustrate that, in presence of Markov process model misspecification, counterfactual inference leverages prior data, and therefore estimates the outcome of an intervention more accurately than a direct simulation.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/2d44e06a7038f2dd98f0f54c4be35e22-Paper.pdf,2019,"counterfactual, inference, markov, causal, model, models, process, structural, equilibrium, system","model, counterfactual, k3, process, equilibrium, markov, distribution, xi, causal, intervention","{'enables': 0.37134097804265903, 'counterfactual': 0.35145165423022273, 'integrating': 0.35145165423022273, 'complex': 0.3373399544079538, 'structural': 0.3174506305955175, 'systems': 0.2975613067830811, 'markov': 0.26933790713854333, 'causal': 0.26356028314837593, 'modeling': 0.24016567504508282, 'processes': 0.23850269856316617}","{'counterfactual': 0.5478102667544552, 'markov': 0.26449833324557953, 'inference': 0.25944343677091136, 'causal': 0.24432603646433596, 'structural': 0.24156139834475215, 'equilibrium': 0.2037208606697092, 'manuscript': 0.19877783690151493, 'process': 0.17152340675006222, 'intervention': 0.16237652204437805, 'system': 0.15927400282101908}"

Stacked Capsule Autoencoders,"Adam Kosiorek, Sara Sabour, Yee Whye Teh, Geoffrey E. Hinton","Objects are composed of a set of geometrically organized parts. We introduce an unsupervised capsule autoencoder (SCAE), which explicitly uses geometric relationships between parts to reason about objects.
 Since these relationships do not depend on the viewpoint, our model is robust to viewpoint changes.
SCAE consists of two stages.
In the first stage, the model predicts presences and poses of part templates directly from the image and tries to reconstruct the image by appropriately arranging the templates.
In the second stage, the SCAE predicts parameters of a few object capsules, which are then used to reconstruct part poses.
Inference in this model is amortized and performed by off-the-shelf neural encoders, unlike in previous capsule networks.

Progressive Augmentation of GANs,"Dan Zhang, Anna Khoreva","Training of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is notoriously fragile, requiring to maintain a careful balance between the generator and the discriminator in order to perform well. To mitigate this issue we introduce a new regularization technique - progressive augmentation of GANs (PA-GAN). The key idea is to gradually increase the task difficulty of the discriminator by progressively augmenting its input or feature space, thus enabling continuous learning of the generator. We show that the proposed progressive augmentation preserves the original GAN objective, does not compromise the discriminator's optimality and encourages a healthy competition between the generator and discriminator, leading to the better-performing generator. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of PA-GAN across different architectures and on multiple benchmarks for the image synthesis task, on average achieving 3 point improvement of the FID score.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/2e2c080d5490760af59d0baf5acbb84e-Paper.pdf,2019,"discriminator, generator, gan, augmentation, gans, pa, progressive, task, achieving, across","pa, discriminator, augmentation, gan, sl, input, samples, training, fid, level","{'progressive': 0.654961528765608, 'augmentation': 0.559911139940395, 'gans': 0.5074691234032521}","{'discriminator': 0.37256745774227956, 'generator': 0.3622060293579551, 'pa': 0.283886033284229, 'gan': 0.27165452201846635, 'progressive': 0.22748229803987935, 'augmentation': 0.19229666703682322, 'gans': 0.1836039781522451, 'compromise': 0.13434043360430944, 'healthy': 0.13434043360430944, 'fragile': 0.12894631509554974}"
Online sampling from log-concave distributions,"Holden Lee, Oren Mangoubi, Nisheeth Vishnoi","Given a sequence of convex functions $f_0, f_1, \ldots, f_T$, we study the problem of sampling from the Gibbs distribution $\pi_t \propto e^{-\sum_{k=0}^t f_k}$ for each epoch $t$ in an {\em online} manner. Interest in this problem derives from applications in machine learning, Bayesian statistics, and optimization where, rather than obtaining all the observations at once, one constantly acquires new data, and must continuously update the distribution. Our main result is an algorithm that generates roughly independent samples from $\pi_t$ for every epoch $t$ and, under mild assumptions, makes  $\mathrm{polylog}(T)$ gradient evaluations per epoch. All previous results imply a bound on the number of gradient or function evaluations which is at least linear in $T$. Motivated by real-world applications, we assume that functions are smooth, their associated distributions have a bounded second moment, and their minimizer drifts in a bounded manner, but do not assume they are strongly convex.  In particular, our assumptions hold for online Bayesian logistic regression, when the data satisfy natural regularity properties, giving a sampling algorithm with updates that are poly-logarithmic in $T$.  In simulations, our algorithm achieves accuracy comparable to an algorithm specialized to logistic regression.  Key to our algorithm is a novel stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics Markov chain with a carefully designed variance reduction step and constant batch size. Technically, lack of strong convexity is a significant barrier to analysis and, here, our main contribution is a martingale exit time argument that shows our Markov chain remains in a ball of radius roughly poly-logarithmic in $T$ for enough time to reach within $\epsilon$ of $\pi_t$.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/2e65f2f2fdaf6c699b223c61b1b5ab89-Paper.pdf,2019,"algorithm, epoch, gradient, pi_t, applications, assume, assumptions, bayesian, bounded, chain","online, gradient, epoch, algorithm, distribution, chain, ft, ot, sample, sampling","{'concave': 0.4958835760389884, 'log': 0.4958835760389884, 'distributions': 0.4510082039869922, 'sampling': 0.39834130879389545, 'online': 0.3822496038903947}","{'pi_t': 0.30179744379090645, 'epoch': 0.28028007466099214, 'roughly': 0.17034726431986746, 'algorithm': 0.15640507422608516, 'logistic': 0.15248754282938592, 'poly': 0.15248754282938592, 'chain': 0.14524723242575618, 'assume': 0.13748953508020512, 'logarithmic': 0.13748953508020512, 'evaluations': 0.13653751783916884}"
Practical Two-Step Lookahead Bayesian Optimization,"Jian Wu, Peter Frazier","Expected improvement and other acquisition functions widely used in Bayesian optimization use a ""one-step"" assumption: they value objective function evaluations assuming no future evaluations will be performed. Because we usually evaluate over multiple steps, this assumption may leave substantial room for improvement. Existing theory gives acquisition functions looking multiple steps in the future but calculating them requires solving a high-dimensional continuous-state continuous-action Markov decision process (MDP). Fast exact solutions of this MDP remain out of reach of today's methods. As a result, previous two- and multi-step lookahead Bayesian optimization algorithms are either too expensive to implement in most practical settings or resort to heuristics that may fail to fully realize the promise of two-step lookahead. This paper proposes a computationally efficient algorithm that provides an accurate solution to the two-step lookahead Bayesian optimization problem in seconds to at most several minutes of computation per batch of evaluations. The resulting acquisition function provides increased query efficiency and robustness compared with previous two- and multi-step lookahead methods in both single-threaded and batch experiments. This unlocks the value of two-step lookahead in practice. We demonstrate the value of our algorithm with extensive experiments on synthetic test functions and real-world problems.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/2e6d9c6052e99fcdfa61d9b9da273ca2-Paper.pdf,2019,"step, lookahead, two, acquisition, bayesian, evaluations, functions, optimization, value, algorithm","x1, opt, al, et, step, function, two, x2, acquisition, 2016","{'lookahead': 0.5171775711153447, 'practical': 0.44637744495938025, 'two': 0.4171093733579752, 'step': 0.41133157484335076, 'bayesian': 0.3284194548486777, 'optimization': 0.28677744757472057}","{'lookahead': 0.4802204415578696, 'step': 0.301654585544063, 'acquisition': 0.23874927924206885, 'evaluations': 0.20371237332576098, 'two': 0.16958243859606778, 'value': 0.15815113262668268, 'bayesian': 0.15368971498917255, 'mdp': 0.15007654313911417, 'functions': 0.13279822804040903, 'assumption': 0.12386895551746056}"
Generalized Block-Diagonal Structure Pursuit: Learning Soft Latent Task Assignment against Negative Transfer,"Zhiyong Yang, Qianqian Xu, Yangbangyan Jiang, Xiaochun Cao, Qingming Huang","In multi-task learning, a major challenge springs from a notorious issue known as negative transfer, which refers to the phenomenon that sharing the knowledge with dissimilar and hard tasks often results in a worsened performance. To circumvent this issue, we propose a novel multi-task learning method, which simultaneously learns latent task representations and a block-diagonal Latent Task Assignment Matrix (LTAM). Different from most of the previous work, pursuing the Block-Diagonal structure of LTAM (assigning latent tasks to output tasks) alleviates negative transfer via collaboratively grouping latent tasks and output tasks such that inter-group knowledge transfer and sharing is suppressed. This goal is challenging, since 1) our notion of Block-Diagonal Property extends the traditional notion for square matrices where the $i$-th column and the $i$-th column represents the same concept; 2) marginal constraints on rows and columns are also required for avoiding isolated latent/output tasks. Facing such challenges, we propose  a novel regularizer by means of an equivalent spectral condition realizing this generalized block-diagonal property. Practically, we provide a relaxation scheme which improves the flexibility of the model. With the objective function given, we then propose an alternating optimization method, which not only tells how negative transfer is alleviated in our method but also reveals an interesting connection between our method and the optimal transport problem.  Finally, the method is demonstrated on a simulation dataset, three real-world benchmark datasets and further applied to personalized attribute predictions.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/2ecd2bd94734e5dd392d8678bc64cdab-Paper.pdf,2019,"tasks, latent, method, block, diagonal, task, transfer, negative, output, propose","task, latent, tasks, al, et, block, structure, diagonal, model, problem","{'diagonal': 0.3614249538873388, 'assignment': 0.34206674036711066, 'negative': 0.34206674036711066, 'pursuit': 0.3283318692941164, 'soft': 0.317678275617074, 'block': 0.2896154422536601, 'generalized': 0.26852091996848726, 'task': 0.26214570010767163, 'transfer': 0.25652235766043774, 'latent': 0.2514921064306292}","{'diagonal': 0.35866199143712557, 'block': 0.2502116757685293, 'latent': 0.24607969619774228, 'transfer': 0.23857394126415457, 'tasks': 0.20208131897954176, 'ltam': 0.1974060483299955, 'negative': 0.17992076664436482, 'column': 0.16125594310713007, 'task': 0.15437587818115575, 'method': 0.14925832390623744}"

"N-Gram Graph: Simple Unsupervised Representation for Graphs, with Applications to Molecules","Shengchao Liu, Mehmet F.

An important task is to predict the properties of molecules, which serves as the main subroutine in many downstream applications such as virtual screening and drug design. Despite the increasing interest, the key challenge is to construct proper representations of molecules for learning algorithms. This paper introduces the N-gram graph, a simple unsupervised representation for molecules. The method first embeds the vertices in the molecule graph. It then constructs a compact representation for the graph by assembling the vertex embeddings in short walks in the graph, which we show is equivalent to a simple graph neural network that needs no training. The representations can thus be efficiently computed and then used with supervised learning methods for prediction.

A very popular and widely explored type of dimensionality reduction is sparsity; another type is generative modelling of signal distributions. Generative models based on neural networks, such as GANs or variational auto-encoders, are particularly performant and are gaining on applicability. In this paper we study spiked matrix models, where a low-rank matrix is observed through a noisy channel. This problem with sparse structure of the spikes has attracted broad attention in the past literature. Here, we replace the sparsity assumption by generative modelling, and investigate the consequences on statistical and algorithmic properties. We analyze the Bayes-optimal performance under specific generative models for the spike. In contrast with the sparsity assumption, we do not observe regions of parameters where statistical performance is superior to the best known algorithmic performance. We show that in the analyzed cases the approximate message passing algorithm is able to reach optimal performance.

"The Step Decay Schedule: A Near Optimal, Geometrically Decaying Learning Rate Procedure For Least Squares","Rong Ge, Sham M. Kakade, Rahul Kidambi, Praneeth Netrapalli","Minimax optimal convergence rates for numerous classes of stochastic convex optimization problems are well characterized, where the majority of results utilize iterate averaged stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with polynomially decaying step sizes. In contrast, the behavior of SGD’s final iterate has received much less attention despite the widespread use in practice. Motivated by this observation, this work provides a detailed study of the following question: what rate is achievable using the final iterate of SGD for the streaming least squares regression problem with and without strong convexity? 


First, this work shows that even if the time horizon T (i.e. the number of iterations that SGD is run for) is known in advance, the behavior of SGD’s final iterate with any polynomially decaying learning rate scheme is highly sub-optimal compared to the statistical minimax rate (by a condition number factor in the strongly convex case and a factor of $\sqrt{T}$ in the non-strongly convex case). In contrast, this paper shows that Step Decay schedules, which cut the learning rate by a constant factor every constant number of epochs (i.e., the learning rate decays geometrically) offer significant improvements over any polynomially decaying step size schedule. In particular, the behavior of the final iterate with step decay schedules is off from the statistical minimax rate by only log factors (in the condition number for the strongly convex case, and in T in the non-strongly convex case). Finally, in stark contrast to the known horizon case, this paper shows that the anytime (i.e. the limiting) behavior of SGD’s final iterate is poor (in that it queries iterates with highly sub-optimal function value infinitely often, i.e. in a limsup sense) irrespective of the step size scheme employed. These results demonstrate the subtlety in establishing optimal learning rate schedules (for the final iterate) for stochastic gradient procedures in fixed time horizon settings.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/2f4059ce1227f021edc5d9c6f0f17dc1-Paper.pdf,2019,"iterate, rate, final, sgd, case, convex, step, behavior, learning, number","iterate, sgd, ﬁnal, decay, rate, convex, stochastic, minimax, case, step","{'decaying': 0.34594326104945017, 'geometrically': 0.34594326104945017, 'procedure': 0.34594326104945017, 'schedule': 0.34594326104945017, 'decay': 0.31426772376506756, 'least': 0.2825921864806849, 'squares': 0.2825921864806849, 'near': 0.27720972076195016, 'rate': 0.26040538207324426, 'step': 0.26040538207324426}","{'iterate': 0.4106719476817906, 'final': 0.29272004975088295, 'sgd': 0.2684230861766533, 'rate': 0.23702629839552813, 'decaying': 0.19953063157491782, 'schedules': 0.18329391219750382, 'strongly': 0.1779438521025658, 'polynomially': 0.17600226329219595, 'step': 0.17407899454530387, 'convex': 0.16420960707558813}"
Understanding and Improving Layer Normalization,"Jingjing Xu, Xu Sun, Zhiyuan Zhang, Guangxiang Zhao, Junyang Lin","Layer normalization (LayerNorm) is a technique to normalize the distributions of intermediate layers. It enables smoother gradients, faster training, and better generalization accuracy. However, it is still unclear where the effectiveness stems from. In this paper, our main contribution is to take a step further in understanding LayerNorm.  Many of previous studies believe that the success of LayerNorm comes from  forward normalization. Unlike them, we find that the derivatives of the mean and variance are more important than forward normalization by re-centering and re-scaling backward gradients. Furthermore, we find that the parameters of LayerNorm, including the bias and gain, increase the risk of over-fitting and do not work in most cases. Experiments show that a simple version  of LayerNorm (LayerNorm-simple) without the bias and gain outperforms LayerNorm on four datasets. It obtains the state-of-the-art performance on En-Vi machine translation.

Generative Modeling by Estimating Gradients of the Data Distribution,"Yang Song, Stefano Ermon","We introduce a new generative model where samples are produced via Langevin dynamics using gradients of the data distribution estimated with score matching. Because gradients can be ill-defined and hard to estimate when the data resides on low-dimensional manifolds, we perturb the data with different levels of Gaussian noise, and jointly estimate the corresponding scores, i.e., the vector fields of gradients of the perturbed data distribution for all noise levels. For sampling, we propose an annealed Langevin dynamics where we use gradients corresponding to gradually decreasing noise levels as the sampling process gets closer to the data manifold. Our framework allows flexible model architectures, requires no sampling during training or the use of adversarial methods, and provides a learning objective that can be used for principled model comparisons.

Much of the literature has focused on maximizing the total value of served requests, achieving efficiency on the passengers’ side. However, such solutions may result in some drivers being assigned to insufficient or undesired trips, therefore losing fairness from the drivers’ perspective.In this paper, we focus on both the system efficiency and the fairness among drivers and quantitatively analyze the trade-offs between these two objectives. In particular, we give an explicit answer to the question of whether there always exists an assignment that achieves any target efficiency and fairness.

Backprop with Approximate Activations for Memory-efficient Network Training,"Ayan Chakrabarti, Benjamin Moseley","Training convolutional neural network models is  memory intensive since back-propagation requires storing activations of all intermediate layers. This presents a practical concern when seeking to deploy very deep architectures in production, especially when models need to be frequently re-trained on updated datasets. In this paper, we propose a new implementation for back-propagation that significantly reduces memory usage, by enabling the use of approximations with negligible computational cost and minimal effect on training performance. The algorithm reuses common buffers to temporarily store full activations and compute the forward pass exactly. It also stores approximate per-layer copies of activations, at significant memory savings, that are used in the backward pass. Compared to simply approximating activations within standard back-propagation, our method limits accumulation of errors across layers. This allows the use of much lower-precision approximations without affecting training accuracy. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet show that our method yields performance close to exact training, while storing activations compactly with as low as 4-bit precision.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/30c8e1ca872524fbf7ea5c519ca397ee-Paper.pdf,2019,"activations, training, back, memory, propagation, approximations, cifar, layers, method, models","training, activations, al, layer, memory, layers, approximation, exact, gradients, method","{'activations': 0.5017629250554202, 'backprop': 0.47488809603411025, 'approximate': 0.36821216300773035, 'memory': 0.3639344540602129, 'training': 0.30320134469890214, 'network': 0.2939377157702779, 'efficient': 0.2763265156775922}","{'activations': 0.40995387369688474, 'back': 0.25513687357679105, 'propagation': 0.23322705840719296, 'storing': 0.21278285795355567, 'memory': 0.19397429843255218, 'pass': 0.19061690686808527, 'approximations': 0.17009124905119402, 'precision': 0.15656883341666586, 'training': 0.15439351020818523, 'cifar': 0.13552505739051382}"

We pose this issue of cross-modal alignment as an optimization problem and develop an approach based on coupled training of autoencoders as a framework for such analyses. We apply this framework to a Patch-seq dataset consisting of transcriptomic and electrophysiological profiles for the same set of neurons to study consistency of representations across modalities, and evaluate cross-modal data prediction ability.

Meta-Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Probabilistic Context Variables,"Lantao Yu, Tianhe Yu, Chelsea Finn, Stefano Ermon","Reinforcement learning demands a reward function, which is often difficult to provide or design in real world applications. While inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) holds promise for automatically learning reward functions from demonstrations, several major challenges remain. First, existing IRL methods learn reward functions from scratch, requiring large numbers of demonstrations to correctly infer the reward for each task the agent may need to perform. Second, and more subtly, existing methods typically assume demonstrations for one, isolated behavior or task, while in practice, it is significantly more natural and scalable to provide datasets of heterogeneous behaviors. To this end, we propose a deep latent variable model that is capable of learning rewards from unstructured, multi-task demonstration data, and critically, use this experience to infer robust rewards for new, structurally-similar tasks from a single demonstration.

R2D2: Reliable and Repeatable Detector and Descriptor,"Jerome Revaud, Cesar De Souza, Martin Humenberger, Philippe Weinzaepfel","Interest point detection and local feature description are fundamental steps in many computer vision applications. Classical approaches are based on a detect-then-describe paradigm where separate handcrafted methods are used to first identify repeatable keypoints and then represent them with a local descriptor. Neural networks trained with metric learning losses have recently caught up with these techniques, focusing on learning repeatable saliency maps for keypoint detection or learning descriptors at the detected keypoint locations. In this work, we argue that repeatable regions are not necessarily discriminative and can therefore lead to select suboptimal keypoints. Furthermore, we claim that descriptors should be learned only in regions for which matching can be performed with high confidence.

First Order Motion Model for Image Animation,"Aliaksandr Siarohin, Stéphane Lathuilière, Sergey Tulyakov, Elisa Ricci, Nicu Sebe","Image animation consists of generating a video sequence so that an object in a source image is animated according to the motion of a driving video. Our framework addresses this problem without using any annotation or prior information about the specific object to animate. Once trained on a set of videos depicting objects of the same category (e.g. faces, human bodies), our method can be applied to any object of this class. To achieve this, we decouple appearance and motion information using a self-supervised formulation. To support complex motions, we use a representation consisting of a set of learned keypoints along with their local affine transformations. A generator network models occlusions arising during target motions and combines the appearance extracted from the source image and the motion derived from the driving video.

Anti-efficient encoding in emergent communication,"Rahma Chaabouni, Eugene Kharitonov, Emmanuel Dupoux, Marco Baroni","Despite renewed interest in emergent language simulations with
  neural networks, little is known about the basic properties of the
  induced code, and how they compare to human language. One
  fundamental characteristic of the latter, known as Zipf's Law of
  Abbreviation (ZLA), is that more frequent words are efficiently
  associated to shorter strings. We study whether the same pattern
  emerges when two neural networks, aspeaker'' and alistener'',
  are trained to play a signaling game. Surprisingly, we find that
  networks develop an \emph{anti-efficient} encoding scheme, 
  in which the most frequent inputs are associated to the longest messages, 
  and messages in general are skewed towards the maximum length threshold. 
  This anti-efficient code appears easier to discriminate for the listener,
  and, unlike in human communication, the speaker does not impose a
  contrasting least-effort pressure towards brevity. Indeed, when the
  cost function includes a penalty for longer messages, the resulting
  message distribution starts respecting ZLA. Our analysis stresses
  the importance of studying the basic features of emergent
  communication in a highly controlled setup, to ensure the latter
  will not strand too far from human language. Moreover, we present a
  concrete illustration of how different functional pressures can lead
  to successful communication codes that lack basic properties of

Improving Black-box Adversarial Attacks with a Transfer-based Prior,"Shuyu Cheng, Yinpeng Dong, Tianyu Pang, Hang Su, Jun Zhu","We consider the black-box adversarial setting, where the adversary has to generate adversarial perturbations without access to the target models to compute gradients. Previous methods tried to approximate the gradient either by using a transfer gradient of a surrogate white-box model, or based on the query feedback. However, these methods often suffer from low attack success rates or poor query efficiency since it is non-trivial to estimate the gradient in a high-dimensional space with limited information. To address these problems, we propose a prior-guided random gradient-free (P-RGF) method to improve black-box adversarial attacks, which takes the advantage of a transfer-based prior and the query information simultaneously. The transfer-based prior given by the gradient of a surrogate model is appropriately integrated into our algorithm by an optimal coefficient derived by a theoretical analysis.

REM: From Structural Entropy to Community Structure Deception,"Yiwei Liu, Jiamou Liu, Zijian Zhang, Liehuang Zhu, Angsheng Li","This paper focuses on the privacy risks of disclosing the community structure in an online social network.

We investigate CSD through an information-theoretic lens. To this end, we propose a community-based structural entropy to express the amount of information revealed by a community structure.

Unsupervised Object Segmentation by Redrawing,"Mickaël Chen, Thierry Artières, Ludovic Denoyer","Object segmentation is a crucial problem that is usually solved by using supervised learning approaches over very large datasets composed of both images and corresponding object masks. Since the masks have to be provided at pixel level, building such a dataset for any new domain can be very costly. We present ReDO, a new model able to extract objects from images without any annotation in an unsupervised way. It relies on the idea that it should be possible to change the textures or colors of the objects without changing the overall distribution of the dataset. Following this assumption, our approach is based on an adversarial architecture where the generator is guided by an input sample: given an image, it extracts the object mask, then redraws a new object at the same location.

iSplit LBI: Individualized Partial Ranking with Ties via Split LBI,"Qianqian Xu, Xinwei Sun, Zhiyong Yang, Xiaochun Cao, Qingming Huang, Yuan Yao","Due to the inherent uncertainty of data, the problem of predicting partial ranking from pairwise comparison data with ties has attracted increasing interest in recent years. However, in real-world scenarios, different individuals often hold distinct preferences, thus might be misleading to merely look at a global partial ranking while ignoring personal diversity. In this paper, instead of learning a global ranking which is agreed with the consensus, we pursue the tie-aware partial ranking  from an individualized perspective. Particularly, we formulate a unified framework which not only can be used for individualized partial ranking prediction, but can also be helpful for abnormal users selection. This is realized by a variable splitting-based algorithm called iSplit LBI. Specifically, our algorithm  generates a sequence of estimations with a regularization path, where both the hyperparameters and model parameters are updated. At each step of the path, the parameters can be decomposed into three orthogonal parts, namely, abnormal signals, personalized signals and random noise. The abnormal signals can serve the purpose of abnormal user selection, while the  abnormal signals and personalized signals 
together are mainly responsible for user partial ranking prediction.

PointDAN: A Multi-Scale 3D Domain Adaption Network for Point Cloud Representation,"Can Qin, Haoxuan You, Lichen Wang, C.-C. Jay Kuo, Yun Fu","Domain Adaptation (DA) approaches achieved significant improvements in a wide range of machine learning and computer vision tasks (i.e., classification, detection, and segmentation). However, as far as we are aware, there are few methods yet to achieve domain adaptation directly on 3D point cloud data. The unique challenge of point cloud data lies in its abundant spatial geometric information, and the semantics of the whole object is contributed by including regional geometric structures. Specifically, most general-purpose DA methods that struggle for global feature alignment and ignore local geometric information are not suitable for 3D domain alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D Domain Adaptation Network for point cloud data (PointDAN). PointDAN jointly aligns the global and local features in multi-level. For local alignment, we propose Self-Adaptive (SA) node module with an adjusted receptive field to model the discriminative local structures for aligning domains. To represent hierarchically scaled features, node-attention module is further introduced to weight the relationship of SA nodes across objects and domains. For global alignment, an adversarial-training strategy is employed to learn and align global features across domains.

Certified Adversarial Robustness with Additive Noise,"Bai Li, Changyou Chen, Wenlin Wang, Lawrence Carin","The existence of adversarial data examples has drawn significant attention in the deep-learning community; such data are seemingly minimally perturbed relative to the original data, but lead to very different outputs from a deep-learning algorithm. Although a significant body of work on developing defense models has been developed, most such models are heuristic and are often vulnerable to adaptive attacks. Defensive methods that provide theoretical robustness guarantees have been studied intensively, yet most fail to obtain non-trivial robustness when a large-scale model and data are present. To address these limitations, we introduce a framework that is scalable and provides certified bounds on the norm of the input manipulation for constructing adversarial examples. We establish a connection between robustness against adversarial perturbation and additive random noise, and propose a training strategy that can significantly improve the certified bounds.

Stand-Alone Self-Attention in Vision Models,"Prajit Ramachandran, Niki Parmar, Ashish Vaswani, Irwan Bello, Anselm Levskaya, Jon Shlens","Convolutions are a fundamental building block of modern  computer vision systems. Recent approaches have argued for going beyond convolutions in order to capture long-range dependencies. These efforts focus on augmenting convolutional models with content-based interactions, such as self-attention and non-local means, to achieve gains on a number of vision tasks. The natural question that arises is whether attention can be a stand-alone primitive for vision models instead of serving as just an augmentation on top of convolutions. In developing and testing a pure self-attention vision model, we verify that self-attention can indeed be an effective stand-alone layer. A simple procedure of replacing all instances of spatial convolutions with a form of self-attention to ResNet-50 produces a fully self-attentional model that outperforms the baseline on ImageNet classification with 12% fewer FLOPS and 29% fewer parameters. On COCO object detection, a fully self-attention model matches the mAP of a baseline RetinaNet while having 39% fewer FLOPS and 34% fewer parameters. Detailed ablation studies demonstrate that self-attention is especially impactful when used in later layers. These results establish that stand-alone self-attention is an important addition to the vision practitioner's toolbox.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/3416a75f4cea9109507cacd8e2f2aefc-Paper.pdf,2019,"attention, self, vision, convolutions, fewer, alone, model, stand, baseline, flops","attention, convolution, spatial, stem, self, layer, models, convolutions, vision, detection","{'alone': 0.5012875345600674, 'stand': 0.5012875345600674, 'vision': 0.42853887226387544, 'attention': 0.35579020996768357, 'self': 0.33403710227211336, 'models': 0.2749701640996454}","{'self': 0.4115955117462049, 'attention': 0.38569281546253714, 'vision': 0.2749986151903419, 'stand': 0.26525930079950905, 'convolutions': 0.26256168889812664, 'fewer': 0.24901438992109437, 'alone': 0.21097110940910035, 'flops': 0.149723588308135, 'baseline': 0.10945696275953587, 'fully': 0.0943019730441208}"

Globally optimal score-based learning of directed acyclic graphs in high-dimensions,"Bryon Aragam, Arash Amini, Qing Zhou","We prove that $\Omega(s\log p)$ samples suffice to learn a sparse Gaussian directed acyclic graph (DAG) from data, where $s$ is the maximum Markov blanket size. This improves upon recent results that require $\Omega(s^{4}\log p)$ samples in the equal variance case. To prove this, we analyze a popular score-based estimator that has been the subject of extensive empirical inquiry in recent years and is known to achieve state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, the approach we study does not require strong assumptions such as faithfulness that existing theory for score-based learning crucially relies on.  The resulting estimator is based around a difficult nonconvex optimization problem, and its analysis may be of independent interest given recent interest in nonconvex optimization in machine learning. Our analysis overcomes the drawbacks of existing theoretical analyses, which either fail to guarantee structure consistency in high-dimensions (i.e. learning the correct graph with high probability), or rely on restrictive assumptions.

GIFT: Learning Transformation-Invariant Dense Visual Descriptors via Group CNNs,"Yuan Liu, Zehong Shen, Zhixuan Lin, Sida Peng, Hujun Bao, Xiaowei Zhou","Finding local correspondences between images with different viewpoints requires local descriptors that are robust against geometric transformations. An approach for transformation invariance is to integrate out the transformations by pooling the features extracted from transformed versions of an image. However, the feature pooling may sacrifice the distinctiveness of the resulting descriptors. In this paper, we introduce a novel visual descriptor named Group Invariant Feature Transform (GIFT), which is both discriminative and robust to geometric transformations. The key idea is that the features extracted from the transformed versions of an image can be viewed as a function defined on the group of the transformations. Instead of feature pooling, we use group convolutions to exploit underlying structures of the extracted features on the group, resulting in descriptors that are both discriminative and provably invariant to the group of transformations.

Convergence of Adversarial Training in Overparametrized Neural Networks,"Ruiqi Gao, Tianle Cai, Haochuan Li, Cho-Jui Hsieh, Liwei Wang, Jason D.

Adversarial training \cite{madry2017towards}, a heuristic form of robust optimization that alternates between minimization and maximization steps, has proven to be among the most successful methods to train networks to be robust against a pre-defined family of perturbations. This paper provides a partial answer to the success of adversarial training, by showing that it converges to a network where the surrogate loss with respect to the the attack algorithm is within $\epsilon$ of the optimal robust loss. Then we show that the optimal robust loss is also close to zero, hence adversarial training finds a robust classifier. The analysis technique leverages recent work on the analysis of neural networks via Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), combined with motivation from online-learning when the maximization is solved by a heuristic, and the expressiveness of the NTK kernel in the $\ell_\infty$-norm.

Fast and Furious Learning in Zero-Sum Games: Vanishing Regret with Non-Vanishing Step Sizes,"James Bailey, Georgios Piliouras","We show for the first time that it is possible to  reconcile in online learning in zero-sum games two seemingly contradictory objectives: vanishing time-average regret and non-vanishing step sizes. This phenomenon, that we coin   ``fast and furious"" learning in games, sets a new benchmark about what is possible both in  max-min optimization as well as in multi-agent systems. Our analysis does not depend on introducing a carefully tailored  dynamic. Instead we focus on the most well studied online dynamic, gradient descent. Similarly, we focus on the simplest textbook class of games, two-agent two-strategy zero-sum games, such as Matching Pennies. Even for this simplest of benchmarks the best known bound for total regret, prior to our work, was the trivial one of $O(T)$, which is immediately applicable even to a non-learning agent.  Based on a tight understanding of the geometry of the non-equilibrating trajectories in the dual space we prove a regret bound of $\Theta(\sqrt{T})$ matching the well known optimal bound for adaptive step sizes in the online setting. This guarantee holds for all fixed step-sizes without having to know the time horizon in advance and adapt the fixed step-size accordingly.As a corollary, we establish that even with fixed learning rates the time-average of mixed strategies, utilities converge to their exact Nash equilibrium values.

Slice-based Learning: A Programming Model for Residual Learning in Critical Data Slices,"Vincent Chen, Sen Wu, Alexander J. Ratner, Jen Weng, Christopher Ré","In real-world machine learning applications, data subsets correspond to especially critical outcomes: vulnerable cyclist detections are safety-critical in an autonomous driving task, and ""question"" sentences might be important to a dialogue agent's language understanding for product purposes.  While machine learning models can achieve quality performance on coarse-grained metrics like F1-score and overall accuracy, they may underperform on these critical subsets---we define these as slices, the key abstraction in our approach. To address slice-level performance, practitioners often train separate ""expert"" models on slice subsets or use multi-task hard parameter sharing.  We propose Slice-based Learning, a new programming model in which the slicing function (SF), a programmer abstraction, is used to specify additional model capacity for each slice.  Any model can leverage SFs to learn slice-specific representations, which are combined with an attention mechanism to make slice-aware predictions.

In comparison to previous minibatched Gibbs algorithms, Poisson-minibatching Gibbs supports fast sampling from continuous state spaces and avoids the need for a Metropolis-Hastings correction on discrete state spaces.

Theoretical evidence for adversarial robustness through randomization,"Rafael Pinot, Laurent Meunier, Alexandre Araujo, Hisashi Kashima, Florian Yger, Cedric Gouy-Pailler, Jamal Atif","This paper investigates the theory of robustness against adversarial attacks. It
focuses on the family of randomization techniques that consist in injecting noise
in the network at inference time. These techniques have proven effective in many
contexts, but lack theoretical arguments. We close this gap by presenting a theo-
retical analysis of these approaches, hence explaining why they perform well in
practice. More precisely, we make two new contributions. The first one relates
the randomization rate to robustness to adversarial attacks. This result applies for
the general family of exponential distributions, and thus extends and unifies the

On Mixup Training: Improved Calibration and Predictive Uncertainty for Deep Neural Networks,"Sunil Thulasidasan, Gopinath Chennupati, Jeff A. Bilmes, Tanmoy Bhattacharya, Sarah Michalak","Mixup~\cite{zhang2017mixup} is  a recently proposed  method for training deep neural networks  where additional samples are generated during training  by convexly combining random pairs of images and their associated labels. While simple to implement, it has shown to be a surprisingly effective method of data augmentation for image classification;  DNNs trained with mixup show noticeable gains in classification performance on a number of  image classification benchmarks. In this work, we discuss a hitherto untouched aspect of mixup training -- the calibration and predictive uncertainty   of models trained with mixup. We find that DNNs trained with mixup  are significantly better calibrated --  i.e the predicted softmax scores  are  much better indicators of the actual likelihood of a correct prediction --  than DNNs trained in the regular fashion. We conduct experiments on a number of image classification architectures and datasets --  including large-scale datasets like ImageNet -- and find this to be the case.Additionally, we find that merely mixing features does not result in the same calibration benefit and that the label smoothing in mixup training plays a significant role in improving calibration.  Finally,  we also observe that mixup-trained DNNs are less prone to over-confident predictions on out-of-distribution and random-noise data.  We conclude that the  typical overconfidence seen in neural networks, even on in-distribution data is likely a consequence of training with hard labels, suggesting that mixup training be employed for classification tasks where predictive uncertainty is a significant concern.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/36ad8b5f42db492827016448975cc22d-Paper.pdf,2019,"mixup, training, classification, trained, dnns, calibration, data, find, image, better","mixup, training, calibration, data, effect, distribution, label, trained, classiﬁcation, smoothing","{'mixup': 0.44611866149743445, 'predictive': 0.4282058346252631, 'calibration': 0.3933607688942341, 'improved': 0.37115202830096405, 'uncertainty': 0.3381119020471709, 'training': 0.2848329515751449, 'deep': 0.22128105911378335, 'networks': 0.20089375887288566, 'neural': 0.20089375887288566}","{'mixup': 0.6478065877623057, 'dnns': 0.27215946449348466, 'calibration': 0.19623717572161106, 'trained': 0.18733291886449296, 'classification': 0.18208843768246158, 'training': 0.17054677397463372, 'find': 0.11733676470531787, 'image': 0.11006515463752466, 'predictive': 0.10343301072233733, 'uncertainty': 0.10065926362127667}"
Thompson Sampling for Multinomial Logit Contextual Bandits,"Min-hwan Oh, Garud Iyengar","We consider a dynamic assortment selection problem where the goal is to offer a sequence of assortments that maximizes the expected cumulative revenue, or alternatively, minimize the expected regret.

The utility of each item is a dynamic function of contextual information of both the item and the user.
We propose two Thompson sampling algorithms for this multinomial logit contextual bandit. Our first algorithm maintains a posterior distribution of the true parameter and establishes  $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{T})$ Bayesian regret over $T$ rounds with $d$ dimensional context vector. The worst-case computational complexity of this algorithm could be high when the prior distribution is not a conjugate.  The second algorithm approximates the posterior by a Gaussian distribution, and uses a new optimistic sampling procedure to address the issues that arise in worst-case regret analysis.

Mining GOLD Samples for Conditional GANs,"Sangwoo Mo, Chiheon Kim, Sungwoong Kim, Minsu Cho, Jinwoo Shin","Conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) have gained a considerable attention in recent years due to its class-wise controllability and superior quality for complex generation tasks. We introduce a simple yet effective approach to improving cGANs by measuring the discrepancy between the data distribution and the model distribution on given samples.

Few-shot Video-to-Video Synthesis,"Ting-Chun Wang, Ming-Yu Liu, Andrew Tao, Guilin Liu, Bryan Catanzaro, Jan Kautz","Video-to-video synthesis (vid2vid) aims at converting an input semantic video, such as videos of human poses or segmentation masks, to an output photorealistic video. While the state-of-the-art of vid2vid has advanced significantly, existing approaches share two major limitations. First, they are data-hungry. Numerous images of a target human subject or a scene are required for training. Second, a learned model has limited generalization capability. A pose-to-human vid2vid model can only synthesize poses of the single person in the training set. It does not generalize to other humans that are not in the training set. To address the limitations, we propose a few-shot vid2vid framework, which learns to synthesize videos of previously unseen subjects or scenes by leveraging few example images of the target at test time. Our model achieves this few-shot generalization capability via a novel network weight generation module utilizing an attention mechanism. We conduct extensive experimental validations with comparisons to strong baselines using several large-scale video datasets including human-dancing videos, talking-head videos, and street-scene videos.

Unlocking Fairness: a Trade-off Revisited,"Michael Wick, swetasudha panda, Jean-Baptiste Tristan","The prevailing wisdom is that a model's fairness and its accuracy
  are in tension with one another.  However, there is a pernicious
  {\em modeling-evaluating dualism} bedeviling fair machine learning
  in which phenomena such as label bias are appropriately acknowledged
  as a source of unfairness when designing fair models,
  only to be tacitly abandoned when evaluating them.  We investigate
  fairness and accuracy, but this time under a variety of controlled
  conditions in which we vary the amount and type of bias.  We find,
  under reasonable assumptions, that the tension between fairness and
  accuracy is illusive, and vanishes as soon as we account for these
  phenomena during evaluation.  Moreover, our results are consistent
  with an opposing conclusion: fairness and accuracy are sometimes in
  accord.  This raises the question, {\em might there be a way to
    harness fairness to improve accuracy after all?}  Since most
  notions of fairness are with respect to the model's predictions and
  not the ground truth labels, this provides an opportunity to see if
  we can improve accuracy by harnessing appropriate notions of
  fairness over large quantities of {\em unlabeled} data with
  techniques like posterior regularization and generalized
  expectation.  Indeed, we find that semi-supervision not only
  improves fairness, but also accuracy and has advantages over

Stochastic Shared Embeddings: Data-driven Regularization of Embedding Layers,"Liwei Wu, Shuqing Li, Cho-Jui Hsieh, James L. Sharpnack","In deep neural nets, lower level embedding layers account for a large portion of the total number of parameters. Tikhonov regularization, graph-based regularization, and hard parameter sharing are approaches that introduce explicit biases into training in a hope to reduce statistical complexity. Alternatively, we propose stochastically shared embeddings (SSE), a data-driven approach to regularizing embedding layers, which stochastically transitions between embeddings during stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Because SSE integrates seamlessly with existing SGD algorithms, it can be used with only minor modifications when training large scale neural networks. We develop two versions of SSE: SSE-Graph using knowledge graphs of embeddings; SSE-SE using no prior information. We provide theoretical guarantees for our method and show its empirical effectiveness on 6 distinct tasks, from simple neural networks with one hidden layer in recommender systems, to the transformer and BERT in natural languages.

An Algorithmic Framework For Differentially Private Data Analysis on Trusted Processors,"Joshua Allen, Bolin Ding, Janardhan Kulkarni, Harsha Nori, Olga Ohrimenko, Sergey Yekhanin","Differential privacy has emerged as the main definition for private data analysis and machine learning. The global model of differential privacy, which assumes that users trust the data collector, provides strong privacy guarantees and introduces small errors in the output. In contrast, applications of differential privacy in commercial systems by Apple, Google, and Microsoft, use the local model. Here, users do not trust the data collector, and hence randomize their data before sending it to the data collector. Unfortunately, local model is too strong for several important applications and hence is limited in its applicability.

Evaluating Protein Transfer Learning with TAPE,"Roshan Rao, Nicholas Bhattacharya, Neil Thomas, Yan Duan, Peter Chen, John Canny, Pieter Abbeel, Yun Song","Protein modeling is an increasingly popular area of machine learning research. Semi-supervised learning has emerged as an important paradigm in protein modeling due to the high cost of acquiring supervised protein labels, but the current literature is fragmented when it comes to datasets and standardized evaluation techniques. To facilitate progress in this field, we introduce the Tasks Assessing Protein Embeddings (TAPE), a set of five biologically relevant semi-supervised learning tasks spread across different domains of protein biology. We curate tasks into specific training, validation, and test splits to ensure that each task tests biologically relevant generalization that transfers to real-life scenarios. We benchmark a range of approaches to semi-supervised protein representation learning, which span recent work as well as canonical sequence learning techniques. We find that self-supervised pretraining is helpful for almost all models on all tasks, more than doubling performance in some cases. Despite this increase, in several cases features learned by self-supervised pretraining still lag behind features extracted by state-of-the-art non-neural techniques. This gap in performance suggests a huge opportunity for innovative architecture design and improved modeling paradigms that better capture the signal in biological sequences.

The goal is to minimize the distance of the rank produced to the true rank of the elements measured by the Kendall-Tau distance, which corresponds to the number of pairs that are inverted with respect to the true order.Our main result is a matching upper and lower bound for the secretary ranking problem. We present an algorithm that ranks n elements with only O(n^{3/2}) inversions in expectation, and show that any algorithm necessarily suffers \Omega(n^{3/2}) inversions when there are n available positions.

Building on these results, we obtain a closed form implicit equation for $L_{\max}$, the maximal trainable depth (and hence model capacity), given $N$, the number of quantization levels in the activation function.

research problem. In this paper, we present DISN, a Deep Implicit Surface Net-
work which can generate a high-quality detail-rich 3D mesh from a 2D image by
predicting the underlying signed distance fields. In addition to utilizing global
image features, DISN predicts the projected location for each 3D point on the
2D image and extracts local features from the image feature maps. Combin-
ing global and local features significantly improves the accuracy of the signed
distance field prediction, especially for the detail-rich areas. To the best of our

RNN based models usually assume a specific functional form for the time course of the intensity function of a point process (e.g., exponentially decreasing or increasing with the time since the most recent event). However, such an assumption can restrict the expressive power of the model. We herein propose a novel RNN based model in which the time course of the intensity function is represented in a general manner. In our approach, we first model the integral of the intensity function using a feedforward neural network and then obtain the intensity function as its derivative. This approach enables us to both obtain a flexible model of the intensity function and exactly evaluate the log-likelihood function, which contains the integral of the intensity function, without any numerical approximations.

However, most recent deep learning approaches in the literature are one-dimensional, i.e, even though they are trained on the whole dataset, during prediction, the future forecast for a single dimension mainly depends on past values from the same dimension. In this paper, we seek to correct this deficiency and propose DeepGLO, a deep forecasting model which thinks globally and acts locally. In particular, DeepGLO is a hybrid model that combines a global matrix factorization model regularized by a temporal convolution network, along with another temporal network that can capture local properties of each time-series and associated covariates. Our model can be trained effectively on high-dimensional but diverse time series, where different time series can have vastly different scales, without a priori normalization or rescaling. Empirical results demonstrate that DeepGLO can outperform state-of-the-art approaches; for example, we see more than 25% improvement in WAPE over other methods on a public dataset that contains more than 100K-dimensional time series.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/3a0844cee4fcf57de0c71e9ad3035478-Paper.pdf,2019,"series, time, dimensional, model, deepglo, dimension, forecasting, high, approaches, dataset","time, series, model, tcn, temporal, global, network, tr, training, data","{'act': 0.37377566424079556, 'think': 0.35375593666190275, 'locally': 0.3285340627605237, 'globally': 0.3195319863160053, 'forecasting': 0.30532776354900076, 'series': 0.28530803597010795, 'dimensional': 0.2681104892670407, 'approach': 0.2626187542936283, 'high': 0.23687986285720597, 'time': 0.2222913990580753}","{'series': 0.4313277658504756, 'deepglo': 0.3201146631567194, 'time': 0.250269409975398, 'dimensional': 0.24041845591580518, 'forecasting': 0.2378294108409538, 'dimension': 0.17845976547872297, 'high': 0.12331611011654262, 'temporal': 0.1226669733096389, 'global': 0.11278166277052197, 'model': 0.11023920484593586}"
Handling correlated and repeated measurements with the smoothed multivariate square-root Lasso,"Quentin Bertrand, Mathurin Massias, Alexandre Gramfort, Joseph Salmon","A limitation of  Lasso-type estimators is that the optimal regularization parameter depends on the unknown noise level. Estimators such as the concomitant Lasso address this dependence by jointly estimating the noise level and the regression coefficients. Additionally, in many applications, the data is obtained by averaging multiple measurements: this reduces the noise variance, but it dramatically reduces sample sizes and prevents refined noise modeling. In this work, we propose a concomitant estimator that can cope with complex noise structure by using non-averaged measurements, its data-fitting term arising as a smoothing of the nuclear norm. The resulting optimization problem is convex and amenable, thanks to smoothing theory, to state-of-the-art optimization techniques that leverage the sparsity of the solutions.

Regression Planning Networks,"Danfei Xu, Roberto Martín-Martín, De-An Huang, Yuke Zhu, Silvio Savarese, Li F. Fei-Fei","Recent learning-to-plan methods have shown promising results on planning directly from observation space. Yet, their ability to plan for long-horizon tasks is limited by the accuracy of the prediction model. On the other hand, classical symbolic planners show remarkable capabilities in solving long-horizon tasks, but they require predefined symbolic rules and symbolic states, restricting their real-world applicability. In this work, we combine the benefits of these two paradigms and propose a learning-to-plan method that can directly generate a long-term symbolic plan conditioned on high-dimensional observations. We borrow the idea of regression (backward) planning from classical planning literature and introduce Regression Planning Networks (RPN), a neural network architecture that plans backward starting at a task goal and generates a sequence of intermediate goals that reaches the current observation. We show that our model not only inherits many favorable traits from symbolic planning --including the ability to solve previously unseen tasks-- but also can learn from visual inputs in an end-to-end manner.

Efficient Neural Architecture Transformation Search in Channel-Level for Object Detection,"Junran Peng, Ming Sun, ZHAO-XIANG ZHANG, Tieniu Tan, Junjie Yan","Recently, Neural Architecture Search has achieved great success in large-scale image classification. In contrast, there have been limited works focusing on architecture search for object detection, mainly because the costly ImageNet pretraining is always required for detectors. Training from scratch, as a substitute, demands more epochs to converge and brings no computation saving.To overcome this obstacle, we introduce a practical neural architecture transformation search(NATS) algorithm for object detection in this paper. Instead of searching and constructing an entire network, NATS explores the architecture space on the base of existing network and reusing its weights.We propose a novel neural architecture search strategy in channel-level instead of path-level and devise a search space specially targeting at object detection. With the combination of these two designs, an architecture transformation scheme could be discovered to adapt a network designed for image classification to task of object detection.Since our method is gradient-based and only searches for a transformation scheme, the weights of models pretrained in ImageNet could be utilized in both searching and retraining stage, which makes the whole process very efficient.The transformed network requires no extra parameters and FLOPs, and is friendly to hardware optimization, which is practical to use in real-time application.In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of NATS on networks like {\em ResNet} and {\em ResNeXt}.

CXPlain: Causal Explanations for Model Interpretation under Uncertainty,"Patrick Schwab, Walter Karlen","Feature importance estimates that inform users about the degree to which given inputs influence the output of a predictive model are crucial for understanding, validating, and interpreting machine-learning models.

Here, we frame the task of providing explanations for the decisions of machine-learning models as a causal learning task, and train causal explanation (CXPlain) models that learn to estimate to what degree certain inputs cause outputs in another machine-learning model. CXPlain can, once trained, be used to explain the target model in little time, and enables the quantification of the uncertainty associated with its feature importance estimates via bootstrap ensembling. We present experiments that demonstrate that CXPlain is significantly more accurate and faster than existing model-agnostic methods for estimating feature importance.

Our approach leverages the principles of deep model compression, critical weights selection, and progressive networks expansion. By enforcing their integration in an iterative manner, we introduce an incremental learning method that is scalable to the number of sequential tasks in a continual learning process. Our approach is easy to implement and owns several favorable characteristics. First, it can avoid forgetting (i.e., learn new tasks while remembering all previous tasks). Second, it allows model expansion but can maintain the model compactness when handling sequential tasks. Besides, through our compaction and selection/expansion mechanism, we show that the knowledge accumulated through learning previous tasks is helpful to build a better model for the new tasks compared to training the models independently with tasks.

Machine Learning Estimation of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects with Instruments,"Vasilis Syrgkanis, Victor Lei, Miruna Oprescu, Maggie Hei, Keith Battocchi, Greg Lewis","We consider the estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects with arbitrary machine learning methods in the presence of unobserved confounders with the aid of a valid instrument. Such settings arise in A/B tests with an intent-to-treat structure, where the experimenter randomizes over which user will receive a recommendation to take an action, and we are interested in the effect of the downstream action. We develop a statistical learning approach to the estimation of heterogeneous effects, reducing the problem to the minimization of an appropriate loss function that depends on a set of auxiliary models (each corresponding to a separate prediction task). The reduction enables the use of all recent algorithmic advances (e.g. neural nets, forests). We show that the estimated effect model is robust to estimation errors in the auxiliary models, by showing that the loss satisfies a Neyman orthogonality criterion. Our approach can be used to estimate projections of the true effect model on simpler hypothesis spaces. When these spaces are parametric, then the parameter estimates are asymptotically normal, which enables construction of confidence sets. We applied our method to estimate the effect of membership on downstream webpage engagement for a major travel webpage, using as an instrument an intent-to-treat A/B test among 4 million users, where some users received an easier membership sign-up process.

Mapping State Space using Landmarks for Universal Goal Reaching,"Zhiao Huang, Fangchen Liu, Hao Su","An agent that has well understood the environment should be able to apply its skills for any given goals, leading to the fundamental problem of learning the Universal Value Function Approximator (UVFA). A UVFA learns to predict the cumulative rewards between all state-goal pairs. However, empirically, the value function for long-range goals is always hard to estimate and may consequently result in failed policy. This has presented challenges to the learning process and the capability of neural networks. We propose a method to address this issue in large MDPs with sparse rewards, in which exploration and routing across remote states are both extremely challenging. Our method explicitly models the environment in a hierarchical manner, with a high-level dynamic landmark-based map abstracting the visited state space, and a low-level value network to derive precise local decisions. We use farthest point sampling to select landmark states from past experience, which has improved exploration compared with simple uniform sampling.

Convergence-Rate-Matching Discretization of Accelerated Optimization Flows Through Opportunistic State-Triggered Control,"Miguel Vaquero, Jorge Cortes","A recent body of exciting work seeks to shed light on the behavior of accelerated methods in optimization via high-resolution differential equations. These differential equations are continuous counterparts of the discrete-time optimization algorithms, and their convergence properties can be characterized using the powerful tools provided by classical Lyapunov stability analysis. An outstanding question of pivotal importance is how to discretize these continuous flows while maintaining their convergence rates. This paper provides a novel approach through the idea of opportunistic state-triggered control. We take advantage of the Lyapunov functions employed to characterize the rate of convergence of high-resolution differential equations to design variable-stepsize forward-Euler discretizations that preserve the Lyapunov decay of the original dynamics.

Principal Component Projection and Regression in Nearly Linear Time through Asymmetric SVRG,"Yujia Jin, Aaron Sidford","Given a n-by-d data matrix A, principal component projection (PCP) and principal component regression (PCR), i.e. projection and regression restricted to the top-eigenspace of A, are fundamental problems in machine learning, optimization, and numerical analysis.

Private Stochastic Convex Optimization with Optimal Rates,"Raef Bassily, Vitaly Feldman, Kunal Talwar, Abhradeep Guha Thakurta","We study differentially private (DP) algorithms for stochastic convex optimization (SCO). In this problem the goal is to approximately minimize the population loss given i.i.d.~samples from a distribution over convex and Lipschitz loss functions. A long line of existing work on private convex optimization focuses on the empirical loss and derives asymptotically tight bounds on the excess empirical loss.  However a significant gap exists in the known bounds for the population loss.

We show that, up to logarithmic factors, the optimal excess population loss for DP algorithms is equal to the larger of the optimal non-private excess population loss, and the optimal excess empirical loss of DP algorithms. This implies that, contrary to intuition based on private ERM, private SCO has asymptotically the same rate of $1/\sqrt{n}$ as non-private SCO in the parameter regime most common in practice. The best previous result in this setting gives rate of $1/n^{1/4}$.

Complexity of Highly Parallel Non-Smooth Convex Optimization,"Sebastien Bubeck, Qijia Jiang, Yin-Tat Lee, Yuanzhi Li, Aaron Sidford","A landmark result of non-smooth convex optimization is that gradient descent is an optimal algorithm whenever the number of computed gradients is smaller than the dimension $d$. In this paper we study the extension of this result to the parallel optimization setting. Namely we consider optimization algorithms interacting with a highly parallel gradient oracle, that is one that can answer $\mathrm{poly}(d)$ gradient queries in parallel. We show that in this case gradient descent is optimal only up to $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d})$ rounds of interactions with the oracle. The lower bound improves upon a decades old construction by Nemirovski which proves optimality only up to $d^{1/3}$ rounds (as recently observed by Balkanski and Singer), and the suboptimality of gradient descent after $\sqrt{d}$ rounds was already observed by Duchi, Bartlett and Wainwright.

A Structured Prediction Approach for Generalization in Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,"Nicolas Carion, Nicolas Usunier, Gabriel Synnaeve, Alessandro Lazaric","Effective coordination is crucial to solve multi-agent collaborative (MAC) problems. While centralized reinforcement learning methods can optimally solve small MAC instances, they do not scale to large problems and they fail to generalize to scenarios different from those seen during training. 
In this paper, we consider MAC problems with some intrinsic notion of locality (e.g., geographic proximity) such that interactions between agents and tasks are locally limited. By leveraging this property, we introduce a novel structured prediction approach to assign agents to tasks. At each step, the assignment is obtained by solving a centralized optimization problem (the inference procedure) whose objective function is parameterized by a learned scoring model. We propose different combinations of inference procedures and scoring models able to represent coordination patterns of increasing complexity. The resulting assignment policy can be efficiently learned on small problem instances and readily reused in problems with more agents and tasks (i.e., zero-shot generalization). We report experimental results on a toy search and rescue problem and on several target selection scenarios in StarCraft: Brood War, in which our model significantly outperforms strong rule-based baselines on instances with 5 times more agents and tasks than those seen during training.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/3c3c139bd8467c1587a41081ad78045e-Paper.pdf,2019,"agents, problems, tasks, instances, mac, problem, assignment, centralized, coordination, different","agents, task, tasks, agent, model, policy, coordination, problem, assignment, learning","{'cooperative': 0.44403141808579244, 'agent': 0.3802676658727539, 'structured': 0.3664113535551003, 'approach': 0.35494334104991904, 'generalization': 0.3290667433757905, 'prediction': 0.32672500876557864, 'multi': 0.28648551916238646, 'reinforcement': 0.2749512708317657, 'learning': 0.159010187422338}","{'mac': 0.363084894962797, 'agents': 0.28087663973193255, 'instances': 0.22186223271076058, 'scoring': 0.21275819888987188, 'coordination': 0.2069284667929576, 'centralized': 0.20199949853625435, 'problems': 0.18095341679426175, 'assignment': 0.17556644971487337, 'tasks': 0.1651928997140539, 'seen': 0.1524191435662636}"
Interaction Hard Thresholding: Consistent Sparse Quadratic Regression in Sub-quadratic Time and Space,"Shuo Yang, Yanyao Shen, Sujay Sanghavi","Quadratic regression involves modeling the response as a (generalized) linear function of not only the features $x^{j_1}$ but also of quadratic terms $x^{j_1}x^{j_2}$. The inclusion of such higher-order “interaction terms"" in regression often provides an easy way to increase accuracy in already-high-dimensional problems. However, this explodes the problem dimension from linear $O(p)$ to quadratic $O(p^2)$, and it is common to look for sparse interactions (typically via heuristics). In this paper, we provide a new algorithm – Interaction Hard Thresholding (IntHT) which is the first one to provably accurately solve this problem in sub-quadratic time and space. It is a variant of Iterative Hard Thresholding; one that uses the special quadratic structure to devise a new way to (approx.) extract the top elements of a $p^2$ size gradient in sub-$p^2$ time and space. Our main result is to theoretically prove that, in spite of the many speedup-related approximations, IntHT linearly converges to a consistent estimate under standard high-dimensional sparse recovery assumptions. We also demonstrate its value via synthetic experiments. Moreover, we numerically show that IntHT can be extended to higher-order regression problems, and also theoretically analyze an SVRG variant of IntHT.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/3c7417b8df0daf23f39f445e740c7a43-Paper.pdf,2019,"quadratic, intht, also, regression, dimensional, hard, high, higher, interaction, j_1","quadratic, complexity, linear, algorithm, recovery, gradient, top, elements, size, atee","{'quadratic': 0.5421797770222607, 'sub': 0.3498802973891639, 'hard': 0.3178442739921446, 'interaction': 0.3178442739921446, 'thresholding': 0.3178442739921446, 'consistent': 0.26336894739655564, 'space': 0.25994380942238915, 'sparse': 0.22471905885865467, 'regression': 0.22320357187320256, 'time': 0.2080803761461256}","{'intht': 0.4570906205618824, 'quadratic': 0.3597782599439621, 'j_1': 0.2285453102809412, 'thresholding': 0.1831369151468362, 'regression': 0.17043212126723165, 'interaction': 0.15902980931225938, 'variant': 0.13592018322996907, 'sub': 0.13323484097306182, 'higher': 0.1301827291394169, 'theoretically': 0.12344598103628035}"
Differentially Private Distributed Data Summarization under Covariate Shift,"Kanthi Sarpatwar, Karthikeyan Shanmugam, Venkata Sitaramagiridharganesh Ganapavarapu, Ashish Jagmohan, Roman Vaculin","We envision Artificial Intelligence marketplaces to be platforms where consumers, with very less data for a target task, can obtain a relevant model by accessing many private data sources with vast number of data samples.  One of the key challenges is to construct a training dataset that matches a target task without compromising on privacy of the data sources. To this end, we consider the following distributed data summarizataion problem. Given K private source datasets denoted by $[D_i]_{i\in [K]}$ and a small target validation set $D_v$, which may involve a considerable covariate shift with respect to the sources, compute a summary dataset $D_s\subseteq \bigcup_{i\in [K]} D_i$ such that its statistical distance from the validation dataset $D_v$ is minimized. We use the popular Maximum Mean Discrepancy as the measure of statistical distance. The non-private problem has received considerable attention in prior art, for example in prototype selection (Kim et al., NIPS 2016). Our work is the first to obtain strong differential privacy guarantees while ensuring the quality guarantees of the non-private version. We study this problem in a Parsimonious Curator Privacy Model, where a trusted curator coordinates the summarization process while minimizing the amount of private information accessed. Our central result is a novel protocol that (a) ensures the curator does not access more than $O(K^{\frac{1}{3}}|D_s| + |D_v|)$ points (b) has formal privacy guarantees on the leakage of information between the data owners and (c) closely matches the  best known non-private greedy algorithm. Our protocol uses two hash functions, one inspired by the Rahimi-Recht random features method and the second leverages state of the art differential privacy mechanisms. We introduce a novel ``noiseless'' differentially private auctioning protocol, which may be of independent interest.

We extend previous two-player game approaches for constrained optimization to an approach with three players to decouple the classifier rates from the non-linear objective, and seek to find an equilibrium of the game. Our approach generalizes many existing algorithms, and makes possible new algorithms with more flexibility and tighter handling of non-linear rate constraints.

Stability of Graph Scattering Transforms,"Fernando Gama, Alejandro Ribeiro, Joan Bruna","Scattering transforms are non-trainable deep convolutional architectures that exploit the multi-scale resolution of a wavelet filter bank to obtain an appropriate representation of data. More importantly, they are proven invariant to translations, and stable to perturbations that are close to translations. This stability property dons the scattering transform with a robustness to small changes in the metric domain of the data. When considering network data, regular convolutions do not hold since the data domain presents an irregular structure given by the network topology. In this work, we extend scattering transforms to network data by using multi-resolution graph wavelets, whose computation can be obtained by means of graph convolutions. Furthermore, we prove that the resulting graph scattering transforms are stable to metric perturbations of the underlying network.

A Geometric Perspective on Optimal Representations for Reinforcement Learning,"Marc Bellemare, Will Dabney, Robert Dadashi, Adrien Ali Taiga, Pablo Samuel Castro, Nicolas Le Roux, Dale Schuurmans, Tor Lattimore, Clare Lyle","We propose a new perspective on representation learning in reinforcement learning based on geometric properties of the space of value functions. From there, we provide formal evidence regarding the usefulness of value functions as auxiliary tasks in reinforcement learning. Our formulation considers adapting the representation to minimize the (linear) approximation of the value function of all stationary policies for a given environment. We show that this optimization reduces to making accurate predictions regarding a special class of value functions which we call adversarial value functions (AVFs). We demonstrate that using value functions as auxiliary tasks corresponds to an expected-error relaxation of our formulation, with AVFs a natural candidate, and identify a close relationship with proto-value functions (Mahadevan, 2005).

More Is Less: Learning Efficient Video Representations by Big-Little Network and Depthwise Temporal Aggregation,"Quanfu Fan, Chun-Fu (Richard) Chen, Hilde Kuehne, Marco Pistoia, David Cox","Current state-of-the-art models for video action recognition are mostly based on expensive 3D ConvNets. This results in a need for large GPU clusters to train and evaluate such architectures. To address this problem, we present an lightweight and memory-friendly architecture for action recognition that performs on par with or better than current architectures by using only a fraction of resources.
The proposed architecture is based on a combination of a deep subnet operating on low-resolution frames with a compact subnet operating on high-resolution frames, allowing for high efficiency and accuracy at the same time. We demonstrate that our approach achieves a reduction by 3~4 times in FLOPs and ~2 times in memory usage compared to the baseline. This enables training deeper models with more input frames under the same computational budget.  To further obviate the need for large-scale 3D convolutions, a temporal aggregation module is proposed to model temporal dependencies in a video at very small additional computational costs. Our models achieve strong performance on several action recognition benchmarks including Kinetics, Something-Something and Moments-in-time.

Provably Efficient Q-learning with Function Approximation via Distribution Shift Error Checking Oracle,"Simon S. Du, Yuping Luo, Ruosong Wang, Hanrui Zhang","Q-learning with function approximation is one of the most popular methods in reinforcement learning. Though the idea of using function approximation was proposed at least 60 years ago, even in the simplest setup, i.e, approximating Q-functions with linear functions, it is still an open problem how to design a provably efficient algorithm that learns a near-optimal policy. The key challenges are how to efficiently explore the state space and how to decide when to stop exploring in conjunction with the function approximation scheme.

The current paper presents a provably efficient algorithm for Q-learning with linear function approximation. Under certain regularity assumptions, our algorithm, Difference Maximization Q-learning, combined with linear function approximation, returns a near-optimal policy using polynomial number of trajectories. Our algorithm introduces a new notion, the Distribution Shift Error Checking (DSEC) oracle. This oracle tests whether there exists a function in the function class that predicts well on a distribution $\mathcal{D}_1$, but predicts poorly on another distribution $\mathcal{D}_2$, where $\mathcal{D}_1$ and $\mathcal{D}_2$ are distributions over states induced by two different exploration policies. For the linear function class, this oracle is equivalent to solving a top eigenvalue problem. We believe our algorithmic insights, especially the DSEC oracle, are also useful in designing and analyzing reinforcement learning algorithms with general function approximation.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/3d8e03e8b133b16f13a586f0c01b6866-Paper.pdf,2019,"function, approximation, learning, algorithm, linear, mathcal, oracle, distribution, _1, _2","function, algorithm, learning, policy, oracle, h0, linear, state, approximation, sh","{'checking': 0.40880111301250155, 'oracle': 0.3713701341350907, 'shift': 0.3494744151265196, 'provably': 0.3218890715379058, 'error': 0.31204343624910874, 'distribution': 0.3077210109630409, 'function': 0.2932343566168691, 'approximation': 0.28182335121499685, 'efficient': 0.22513139477451294, 'via': 0.2109633341996481}","{'function': 0.34397191653459547, 'approximation': 0.30077223810696957, 'oracle': 0.28765073979595496, 'mathcal': 0.2809882933996897, 'dsec': 0.21410525894003954, '_1': 0.20263760770625955, '_2': 0.20263760770625955, 'linear': 0.1665970072333889, 'predicts': 0.1535783926587565, 'near': 0.12937783797110256}"
Learner-aware Teaching: Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Preferences and Constraints,"Sebastian Tschiatschek, Ahana Ghosh, Luis Haug, Rati Devidze, Adish Singla","Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) enables an agent to learn complex behavior by observing demonstrations from a (near-)optimal policy.

These preferences can for example capture behavioral biases, mismatched worldviews, or physical constraints. We study two teaching approaches: learner-agnostic teaching, where the teacher provides demonstrations from an optimal policy ignoring the learner's preferences, and learner-aware teaching, where the teacher accounts for the learner’s preferences.

Our new bound consistently beats state-of-the-art bounds both on a toy example and on UCI datasets (with large enough $n$). Theoretically, unlike existing bounds, our new bound can be expected to converge to $0$ faster whenever a Bernstein/Tsybakov condition holds, thus connecting PAC-Bayesian generalization and {\em excess risk\/} bounds---for the latter it has long been known that faster convergence can be obtained under Bernstein conditions.

The algorithm guarantees positivity by performing mirror descent with an appropriately selected Bregman divergence, and a pseudo-gradient is adopted to speed up the gradient evaluation procedure in practice.

The loss observed from an arm is random and depends on the amount of resources allocated to it. More specifically, the loss equals zero if the allocation for the arm exceeds a constant (but unknown) threshold that can be dependent on the arm. Our goal is to learn a feasible allocation that minimizes the expected loss. The problem is challenging because the loss distribution and threshold value of each arm are unknown. We study this novel setting by establishing its `equivalence' to Multiple-Play Multi-Armed Bandits (MP-MAB) and Combinatorial Semi-Bandits.

Defending Against Neural Fake News,"Rowan Zellers, Ari Holtzman, Hannah Rashkin, Yonatan Bisk, Ali Farhadi, Franziska Roesner, Yejin Choi","Recent progress in natural language generation has raised dual-use concerns. While applications like summarization and translation are positive, the underlying technology also might enable adversaries to generate neural fake news: targeted propaganda that closely mimics the style of real news.Modern computer security relies on careful threat modeling: identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities from an adversary's point of view, and exploring potential mitigations to these threats. Likewise, developing robust defenses against neural fake news requires us first to carefully investigate and characterize the risks of these models. We thus present a model for controllable text generation called Grover. Given a headline like 'Link Found Between Vaccines and Autism,' Grover can generate the rest of the article; humans find these generations to be more trustworthy than human-written disinformation.Developing robust verification techniques against generators like Grover is critical. We find that best current discriminators can classify neural fake news from real, human-written, news with 73% accuracy, assuming access to a moderate level of training data. Counterintuitively, the best defense against Grover turns out to be Grover itself, with 92% accuracy, demonstrating the importance of public release of strong generators. We investigate these results further, showing that exposure bias -- and sampling strategies that alleviate its effects -- both leave artifacts that similar discriminators can pick up on.

A Self Validation Network for Object-Level Human Attention Estimation,"Zehua Zhang, Chen Yu, David Crandall","Due to the foveated nature of the human vision system, people can focus their visual attention on a small region of their visual field at a time, which usually contains only a single object. Estimating this object of attention in first-person (egocentric) videos is useful for many human-centered real-world applications such as augmented reality applications and driver assistance systems. A straightforward solution for this problem is to pick the object whose bounding box is hit by the gaze, where eye gaze point estimation is obtained from a traditional eye gaze estimator and object candidates are generated from an off-the-shelf object detector. However, such an approach can fail because it addresses the where and the what problems separately, despite that they are highly related, chicken-and-egg problems.

Learning Robust Global Representations by Penalizing Local Predictive Power,"Haohan Wang, Songwei Ge, Zachary Lipton, Eric P. Xing","Despite their renowned in-domain predictive power, convolutional neural networks are known to rely more on high-frequency patterns that humans deem superficial than on low-frequency patterns that agree better with intuitions about what constitutes category membership. This paper proposes a method for training robust convolutional networks by penalizing the predictive power of the local representations learned by earlier layers. Intuitively, our networks are forced to discard predictive signals such as color and texture that can be gleaned from local receptive fields and to rely instead on the global structures of the image. Across a battery of synthetic and benchmark domain adaptation tasks, our method confers improved generalization out of the domain.

Average-Case Averages: Private Algorithms for Smooth Sensitivity and Mean Estimation,"Mark Bun, Thomas Steinke","The simplest and most widely applied method for guaranteeing differential privacy is to add instance-independent noise to a statistic of interest that is scaled to its global sensitivity. However, global sensitivity is a worst-case notion that is often too conservative for realized dataset instances. We provide methods for scaling noise in an instance-dependent way and demonstrate that they provide greater accuracy under average-case distributional assumptions. Specifically, we consider the basic problem of privately estimating the mean of a real distribution from i.i.d. samples. The standard empirical mean estimator can have arbitrarily-high global sensitivity. We propose the trimmed mean estimator, which interpolates between the mean and the median, as a way of attaining much lower sensitivity on average while losing very little in terms of statistical accuracy. To privately estimate the trimmed mean, we revisit the smooth sensitivity framework of Nissim, Raskhodnikova, and Smith (STOC 2007), which provides a framework for using instance-dependent sensitivity. We propose three new additive noise distributions which provide concentrated differential privacy when scaled to smooth sensitivity. We provide theoretical and experimental evidence showing that our noise distributions compare favorably to others in the literature, in particular, when applied to the mean estimation problem.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/3ef815416f775098fe977004015c6193-Paper.pdf,2019,"sensitivity, mean, noise, provide, global, instance, accuracy, applied, average, case","mean, sensitivity, privacy, distribution, differential, smooth, distributions, trimmed, algorithm, data","{'averages': 0.41604800755461985, 'sensitivity': 0.3937641389996602, 'average': 0.35566961408996495, 'smooth': 0.3333857455350053, 'mean': 0.3275952599054121, 'case': 0.32235712849474935, 'private': 0.2895007349957169, 'algorithms': 0.27300735207035043, 'estimation': 0.2542252270791636}","{'sensitivity': 0.5281773657869342, 'mean': 0.3325517452461516, 'noise': 0.19482504914775, 'trimmed': 0.18974020950638312, 'instance': 0.1807339866882851, 'privately': 0.17138388291002454, 'scaled': 0.16730157499141773, 'global': 0.15892129830293783, 'provide': 0.1445917230777622, 'average': 0.1198511590888404}"
A Regularized Approach to Sparse Optimal Policy in Reinforcement Learning,"Wenhao Yang, Xiang Li, Zhihua Zhang","We propose and study a general framework for regularized Markov decision processes (MDPs) where the goal is to find an optimal policy that maximizes the expected discounted total reward plus a policy regularization term. 
The extant entropy-regularized MDPs can be cast into our framework. 
Moreover, under our framework, many regularization terms can bring multi-modality and sparsity, which are potentially useful in reinforcement learning. 
In particular, we present sufficient and necessary conditions that induce a sparse optimal policy. We also conduct a full mathematical analysis of the proposed regularized MDPs, including the optimality condition, performance error, and sparseness control.

Dynamic Ensemble Modeling Approach to Nonstationary Neural Decoding in Brain-Computer Interfaces,"Yu Qi, Bin Liu, Yueming Wang, Gang Pan","Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have enabled prosthetic device control by decoding motor movements from neural activities. Neural signals recorded from cortex exhibit nonstationary property due to abrupt noises and neuroplastic changes in brain activities during motor control. Current state-of-the-art neural signal decoders such as Kalman filter assume fixed relationship between neural activities and motor movements, thus will fail if this assumption is not satisfied. We propose a dynamic ensemble modeling (DyEnsemble) approach that is capable of adapting to changes in neural signals by employing a proper combination of decoding functions. The DyEnsemble method firstly learns a set of diverse candidate models. Then, it dynamically selects and combines these models online according to Bayesian updating mechanism. Our method can mitigate the effect of noises and cope with different task behaviors by automatic model switching, thus gives more accurate predictions. Experiments with neural data demonstrate that the DyEnsemble method outperforms Kalman filters remarkably, and its advantage is more obvious with noisy signals.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/3f7bcd0b3ea822683bba8fc530f151bd-Paper.pdf,2019,"neural, activities, dyensemble, method, motor, signals, brain, changes, control, decoding","neural, model, dyensemble, signals, y0, candidate, xk, hk, models, neurons","{'nonstationary': 0.37798210056788534, 'computer': 0.3628051341851618, 'interfaces': 0.3628051341851618, 'ensemble': 0.3510329644842329, 'decoding': 0.3414144014826351, 'brain': 0.30943707791933345, 'dynamic': 0.28966973601466134, 'approach': 0.28060359730810197, 'modeling': 0.25829534516397273, 'neural': 0.17021086881878458}","{'dyensemble': 0.33882530863203264, 'activities': 0.282754295419292, 'motor': 0.2715059946768014, 'signals': 0.22760615776582047, 'movements': 0.21378503362142423, 'noises': 0.21378503362142423, 'neural': 0.20540483226189196, 'kalman': 0.1985427193556003, 'decoding': 0.1638359439771445, 'brain': 0.1404795121768141}"
First-order methods almost always avoid saddle points: The case of vanishing step-sizes,"Ioannis Panageas, Georgios Piliouras, Xiao Wang","In a series of papers [Lee et al 2016], [Panageas and Piliouras 2017], [Lee et al 2019], it was established that some of the most commonly used first order methods almost surely (under random initializations) and with step-size being small enough, avoid strict saddle points, as long as the objective function $f$ is $C^2$ and has Lipschitz gradient.  The key observation was that first order methods can be studied from a dynamical systems perspective, in which instantiations of Center-Stable manifold theorem allow for a global analysis. The results of the aforementioned papers were limited to the case where the step-size $\alpha$ is constant, i.e., does not depend on time (and typically bounded from the inverse of the Lipschitz constant of the gradient of $f$). It remains an open question whether or not the results still hold when the step-size is time dependent and vanishes with time.

In this paper, we resolve this question on the affirmative for gradient descent, mirror descent, manifold descent and proximal point. The main technical challenge is that the induced (from each first order method) dynamical system is time non-homogeneous and the stable manifold theorem is not applicable in its classic form. By exploiting the dynamical systems structure of the aforementioned first order methods, we are able to prove a stable manifold theorem that is applicable to time non-homogeneous dynamical systems and generalize the results in [Lee et al 2019] for time dependent step-sizes.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/3fb04953d95a94367bb133f862402bce-Paper.pdf,2019,"time, dynamical, first, manifold, order, step, al, descent, et, gradient","xk, descent, αk, point, theorem, gradient, manifold, saddle, dynamical, stable","{'always': 0.34358105606707107, 'avoid': 0.34358105606707107, 'almost': 0.32517857617929585, 'vanishing': 0.30199419340620126, 'sizes': 0.29371932902227604, 'saddle': 0.2806625617530315, 'first': 0.27531684913450083, 'points': 0.27053494624918145, 'case': 0.2662091889105711, 'step': 0.2586272555414376}","{'manifold': 0.27216478616972706, 'lee': 0.2714012346915547, 'dynamical': 0.26758626373636324, 'theorem': 0.20236930703367498, 'time': 0.20020380457536527, 'stable': 0.19604140677114637, 'step': 0.18942556811672578, 'et': 0.17172370694768535, 'al': 0.170942199030687, 'aforementioned': 0.17026640726749856}"

DETOX: A Redundancy-based Framework for Faster and More Robust Gradient Aggregation,"Shashank Rajput, Hongyi Wang, Zachary Charles, Dimitris Papailiopoulos","To improve the resilience of distributed  training to worst-case, or Byzantine node failures, several recent methods have replaced gradient averaging with robust aggregation methods. Such techniques can have high computational costs, often quadratic in the number of compute nodes, and only have limited robustness guarantees. Other methods have instead used redundancy to guarantee robustness, but can only tolerate limited numbers of Byzantine failures. In this work, we present DETOX, a Byzantine-resilient distributed training framework that combines algorithmic redundancy with robust aggregation. DETOX operates in two steps, a filtering step that uses limited redundancy to significantly reduce the effect of Byzantine nodes, and a hierarchical aggregation step that can be used in tandem with any state-of-the-art robust aggregation method. We show theoretically that this leads to a substantial increase in robustness, and has a per iteration runtime that can be nearly linear in the number of compute nodes. We provide extensive experiments over real distributed setups across a variety of large-scale machine learning tasks, showing that DETOX leads to orders of magnitude accuracy and speedup improvements over many state-of-the-art Byzantine-resilient approaches.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/415185ea244ea2b2bedeb0449b926802-Paper.pdf,2019,"byzantine, aggregation, detox, distributed, limited, methods, nodes, redundancy, robust, robustness","byzantine, detox, nodes, compute, gradient, robust, aggregation, gradients, ps, methods","{'detox': 0.4516773724511822, 'redundancy': 0.4516773724511822, 'faster': 0.39700659091809604, 'aggregation': 0.37693086658697444, 'framework': 0.3009789596860522, 'robust': 0.27146274914080026, 'gradient': 0.26082751102380897, 'based': 0.24489312395639362}","{'byzantine': 0.4905752815196953, 'detox': 0.31100272708987164, 'aggregation': 0.30076516761958444, 'redundancy': 0.2658688851200895, 'resilient': 0.18835096219876257, 'failures': 0.1822394183384007, 'nodes': 0.18218849307972898, 'distributed': 0.17560120118052513, 'robustness': 0.16553093490167456, 'limited': 0.15028667655014724}"
Differentially Private Covariance Estimation,"Kareem Amin, Travis Dick, Alex Kulesza, Andres Munoz, Sergei Vassilvitskii","The covariance matrix of a dataset is a fundamental statistic that can be used for calculating optimum regression weights as well as in many other learning and data analysis settings. For datasets containing private user information, we often want to estimate the covariance matrix in a way that preserves differential privacy. While there are known methods for privately computing the covariance matrix, they all have one of two major shortcomings. Some, like the Gaussian mechanism, only guarantee (epsilon, delta)-differential privacy, leaving a non-trivial probability of privacy failure. Others give strong epsilon-differential privacy guarantees, but are impractical, requiring complicated sampling schemes, and tend to perform poorly on real data.In this work we propose a new epsilon-differentially private algorithm for computing the covariance matrix of a dataset that addresses both of these limitations. We show that it has lower error than existing state-of-the-art approaches, both analytically and empirically.

Meta-Reinforced Synthetic Data for One-Shot Fine-Grained Visual Recognition,"Satoshi Tsutsui, Yanwei Fu, David Crandall","This paper studies the task of one-shot fine-grained recognition, which suffers from the problem of data scarcity of novel fine-grained classes. To alleviate this problem, a off-the-shelf image generator can be applied to synthesize additional images to help one-shot learning. However, such synthesized images may not be helpful in one-shot fine-grained recognition, due to a large domain discrepancy between synthesized and original images. To this end, this paper proposes a meta-learning framework to reinforce the generated images by original images so that these images can facilitate one-shot learning. Specifically, the generic image generator is updated by few training instances of novel classes; and a Meta Image Reinforcing Network (MetaIRNet) is proposed to conduct one-shot fine-grained recognition as well as image reinforcement.

Facility Location Problem in Differential Privacy Model Revisited,"Yunus Esencayi, Marco Gaboardi, Shi Li, Di Wang","In this paper we study the facility location problem in the model of differential privacy (DP) with uniform facility cost. Specifically, we first show that under the hierarchically well-separated tree (HST) metrics and the super-set output setting that was introduced in Gupta et. al., there is an $\epsilon$-DP algorithm that achieves an $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon})$(expected multiplicative) approximation ratio; this implies an $O(\frac{\log n}{\epsilon})$ approximation ratio for the general metric case, where $n$ is the size of the input metric. These bounds improve the best-known results given by Gupta et. al.  In particular, our approximation ratio for HST-metrics is independent of $n$, and the ratio for general metrics is independent of the aspect ratio of the input metric. On the negative side, we show that the approximation ratio of any $\epsilon$-DP algorithm is lower bounded by $\Omega(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon}})$, even for instances on HST metrics with uniform facility cost, under the super-set output setting. The lower bound shows that the dependence of the approximation ratio for HST metrics on $\epsilon$ can not be removed or greatly improved.

Provably robust boosted decision stumps and trees against adversarial attacks,"Maksym Andriushchenko, Matthias Hein","The problem of adversarial robustness has been studied extensively for neural networks. However, for boosted decision trees and decision stumps there are almost no results, even though they are widely used in practice (e.g. XGBoost) due to their accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency. We show in this paper that for boosted decision stumps the \textit{exact} min-max robust loss and test error for an $l_\infty$-attack can be computed in $O(T\log T)$ time per input, where $T$ is the number of decision stumps and the optimal update step of the ensemble can be done in $O(n^2\,T\log T)$, where $n$ is the number of data points. For boosted trees we show how to efficiently calculate and optimize an upper bound on the robust loss, which leads to state-of-the-art robust test error for boosted trees on MNIST (12.5\% for $\epsilon_\infty=0.3$), FMNIST (23.2\% for $\epsilon_\infty=0.1$), and CIFAR-10 (74.7\% for $\epsilon_\infty=8/255$).

where the $m^\star$-th class contains the optimal policy, and we design an
algorithm that achieves $\tilde{O}l(T^{2/3}d^{1/3}_{m^\star})$
regret with no prior knowledge of the optimal dimension

all values of $d_{m^\star}$, and to the best of our knowledge is the first positive result of this type for any online learning setting with partial information. The core of the algorithm is a new estimator for the gap in the best loss

convergence rate faster than the rate required to learn the parameters for either class.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/433371e69eb202f8e7bc8ec2c8d48021-Paper.pdf,2019,"star, optimal, policy, algorithm, bandits, contextual, d_, linear, model, regret","model, regret, selection, al, class, et, optimal, algorithm, contextual, dm","{'selection': 0.5561725512020167, 'contextual': 0.5479219534320785, 'bandits': 0.467579427210281, 'model': 0.4145155069310689}","{'star': 0.5851466042483169, 'd_': 0.29257330212415844, 'contextual': 0.21121184070386287, 'bandits': 0.2059917280451364, 'policy': 0.1986342302011102, 'selection': 0.17233628571404327, 'regret': 0.1595279886774761, 'optimal': 0.15406379257833544, 'result': 0.1383553611227475, 'tilde': 0.13328730283680087}"
Learning-In-The-Loop Optimization: End-To-End Control And Co-Design Of Soft Robots Through Learned Deep Latent Representations,"Andrew Spielberg, Allan Zhao, Yuanming Hu, Tao Du, Wojciech Matusik, Daniela Rus","Soft robots have continuum solid bodies that can deform in an infinite number of ways. Controlling soft robots is very challenging as there are no closed form solutions.  We present a learning-in-the-loop co-optimization algorithm in which a latent state representation is learned as the robot figures out how to solve the task. Our solution marries hybrid particle-grid-based simulation with deep, variational convolutional autoencoder architectures that can capture salient features of robot dynamics with high efficacy. We demonstrate our dynamics-aware feature learning algorithm on both 2D and 3D soft robots, and show that it is more robust and faster converging than the dynamics-oblivious baseline.

Invariance and identifiability issues for word embeddings,"Rachel Carrington, Karthik Bharath, Simon Preston","Word embeddings are commonly obtained as optimisers of a criterion function f of a text corpus, but assessed on word-task performance using a different evaluation function g of the test data. We contend that a possible source of disparity in performance on tasks is the incompatibility between classes of transformations that leave f and g invariant. In particular, word embeddings defined by f are not unique; they are defined only up to a class of transformations to which f is invariant, and this class is larger than the class to which g is invariant.  One implication of this is that the apparent superiority of one word embedding over another, as measured by word task performance, may largely be a consequence of the arbitrary elements selected from the respective solution sets.

PC-Fairness: A Unified Framework for Measuring Causality-based Fairness,"Yongkai Wu, Lu Zhang, Xintao Wu, Hanghang Tong","A recent trend of fair machine learning is to define fairness as causality-based notions which concern the causal connection between protected attributes and decisions. However, one common challenge of all causality-based fairness notions is identifiability, i.e., whether they can be uniquely measured from observational data, which is a critical barrier to applying these notions to real-world situations. In this paper, we develop a framework for measuring different causality-based fairness. We propose a unified definition that covers most of previous causality-based fairness notions, namely the path-specific counterfactual fairness (PC fairness). Based on that, we propose a general method in the form of a constrained optimization problem for bounding the path-specific counterfactual fairness under all unidentifiable situations.

However, due to the lack of rich pictographic evidence in glyphs and the weak generalization ability of  standard computer vision models on character data, an effective way to utilize the glyph information remains to be found.In this paper, we address this gap by presenting  Glyce, the glyph-vectors for Chinese character representations. We make three major innovations:   (1) We use historical Chinese scripts (e.g., bronzeware script, seal script, traditional Chinese, etc) to enrich the pictographic evidence in characters;    (2) We design CNN structures (called tianzege-CNN) tailored to Chinese character image processing; and   (3) We use image-classification as an auxiliary task in a  multi-task learning setup to increase the model's ability to generalize.We show that glyph-based models are able to consistently outperform word/char ID-based models  in a wide range of Chinese NLP tasks.

Stochastic Continuous Greedy ++:  When Upper and Lower Bounds Match,"Amin Karbasi, Hamed Hassani, Aryan Mokhtari, Zebang Shen","In this paper, we develop \scg~(\text{SCG}{$++$}), the first efficient variant of a conditional gradient method for maximizing a  continuous submodular function subject to a convex constraint. Concretely, for a monotone and continuous DR-submodular function, \SCGPP achieves a tight  $[(1-1/e)\OPT -\epsilon]$ solution while using $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ stochastic gradients and $O(1/\epsilon)$ calls to the linear optimization oracle. The best previously known algorithms either achieve a suboptimal $[(1/2)\OPT -\epsilon]$ solution with $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ stochastic gradients or the tight $[(1-1/e)\OPT -\epsilon]$ solution  with suboptimal $O(1/\epsilon^3)$ stochastic gradients. We further provide an information-theoretic lower bound to showcase the necessity of $\OM({1}/{\epsilon^2})$ stochastic oracle queries in order to achieve $[(1-1/e)\OPT -\epsilon]$ for monotone and DR-submodular functions. This result shows that our proposed \SCGPP enjoys optimality in terms of both approximation guarantee, i.e., $(1-1/e)$ approximation factor, and stochastic gradient evaluations, i.e., $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ calls to the stochastic oracle. By using stochastic

General E(2)-Equivariant Steerable CNNs,"Maurice Weiler, Gabriele Cesa","The big empirical success of group equivariant networks has led in recent years to the sprouting of a great variety of equivariant network architectures. A particular focus has thereby been on rotation and reflection equivariant CNNs for planar images. Here we give a general description of E(2)-equivariant convolutions in the framework of Steerable CNNs. The theory of Steerable CNNs thereby yields constraints on the convolution kernels which depend on group representations describing the transformation laws of feature spaces. We show that these constraints for arbitrary group representations can be reduced to constraints under irreducible representations. A general solution of the kernel space constraint is given for arbitrary representations of the Euclidean group E(2) and its subgroups. We implement a wide range of previously proposed and entirely new equivariant network architectures and extensively compare their performances. E(2)-steerable convolutions are further shown to yield remarkable gains on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and STL-10 when used as drop in replacement for non-equivariant convolutions.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/45d6637b718d0f24a237069fe41b0db4-Paper.pdf,2019,"equivariant, group, representations, cnns, constraints, convolutions, steerable, 10, arbitrary, architectures","equivariant, representations, cnns, steerable, group, feature, models, r2, ﬁelds, 10","{'steerable': 0.562559471915859, 'equivariant': 0.5110499455464286, 'cnns': 0.45954041917699817, 'general': 0.45954041917699817}","{'equivariant': 0.5184454682524046, 'steerable': 0.3115814824116005, 'group': 0.27135610647877645, 'convolutions': 0.23130959028993409, 'cnns': 0.2249340522583464, 'representations': 0.1987153727423356, 'constraints': 0.17102198475387628, 'thereby': 0.15130475289416065, 'cifar': 0.12286834536907645, 'arbitrary': 0.11945355488318704}"
On the convergence of single-call stochastic extra-gradient methods,"Yu-Guan Hsieh, Franck Iutzeler, Jérôme Malick, Panayotis Mertikopoulos","Variational inequalities have recently attracted considerable interest in machine learning as a flexible paradigm for models that go beyond ordinary loss function minimization (such as generative adversarial networks and related deep learning systems). In this setting, the optimal O(1/t) convergence rate for solving smooth monotone variational inequalities is achieved by the Extra-Gradient (EG) algorithm and its variants. Aiming to alleviate the cost of an extra gradient step per iteration (which can become quite substantial in deep learning), several algorithms have been proposed as surrogates to Extra-Gradient with a single oracle call per iteration. In this paper, we develop a synthetic view of such algorithms, and we complement the existing literature by showing that they retain a $O(1/t)$ ergodic convergence rate in smooth, deterministic problems. Subsequently, beyond the monotone deterministic case, we also show that the last iterate of single-call, stochastic extra-gradient methods still enjoys a $O(1/t)$ local convergence rate to solutions of non-monotone variational inequalities that satisfy a second-order sufficient condition.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/4625d8e31dad7d1c4c83399a6eb62f0c-Paper.pdf,2019,"extra, gradient, convergence, inequalities, learning, monotone, rate, variational, algorithms, beyond","xt, convergence, eg, monotone, algorithm, gradient, rate, 10, oracle, method","{'call': 0.49076512660998844, 'extra': 0.49076512660998844, 'single': 0.37460767993047644, 'convergence': 0.3324309303040591, 'methods': 0.3244827804905353, 'stochastic': 0.28610087653353655, 'gradient': 0.28339928957765687}","{'extra': 0.3706367829378613, 'inequalities': 0.31053501580334036, 'monotone': 0.30514141823482666, 'variational': 0.19869100108334561, 'gradient': 0.1879723905231613, 'rate': 0.1792305652566643, 'deterministic': 0.16709128504603718, 'convergence': 0.16385145957535185, 'iteration': 0.16166274321304597, 'beyond': 0.15698035892026987}"
Learning nonlinear level sets for dimensionality reduction in function approximation,"Guannan Zhang, Jiaxin Zhang, Jacob Hinkle","We developed a Nonlinear Level-set Learning (NLL) method for dimensionality reduction in high-dimensional function approximation with small data. This work is motivated by a variety of design tasks in real-world engineering applications, where practitioners would replace their computationally intensive physical models (e.g., high-resolution fluid simulators) with fast-to-evaluate predictive machine learning models, so as to accelerate the engineering design processes. There are two major challenges in constructing such predictive models: (a) high-dimensional inputs (e.g., many independent design parameters) and (b) small training data, generated by running extremely time-consuming simulations. Thus, reducing the input dimension is critical to alleviate the over-fitting issue caused by data insufficiency. Existing methods, including sliced inverse regression and active subspace approaches, reduce the input dimension by learning a linear coordinate transformation; our main contribution is to extend the transformation approach to a nonlinear regime. Specifically, we exploit reversible networks (RevNets) to learn nonlinear level sets of a high-dimensional function and parameterize its level sets in low-dimensional spaces. A new loss function was designed to utilize samples of the target functions' gradient to encourage the transformed function to be sensitive to only a few transformed coordinates. The NLL approach is demonstrated by applying it to three 2D functions and two 20D functions for showing the improved approximation accuracy with the use of nonlinear transformation, as well as to an 8D composite material design problem for optimizing the buckling-resistance performance of composite shells of rocket inter-stages.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/464074179972cbbd75a39abc6954cd12-Paper.pdf,2019,"design, dimensional, function, high, nonlinear, data, functions, learning, level, models","function, method, data, sir, transformation, nonlinear, dimensional, nll, eq, input","{'dimensionality': 0.400744581440987, 'level': 0.400744581440987, 'nonlinear': 0.400744581440987, 'sets': 0.400744581440987, 'reduction': 0.3440043256125729, 'function': 0.33625374110434275, 'approximation': 0.32316866710274916, 'learning': 0.14755195674391258}","{'nonlinear': 0.27008127241198787, 'nll': 0.2171381175392671, 'transformation': 0.20919328887569677, 'dimensional': 0.19569491915600587, 'design': 0.19524848359382616, 'engineering': 0.1682402482062704, 'high': 0.1672939799065807, 'level': 0.16051470152664793, 'composite': 0.1593439689106752, 'transformed': 0.157492788558635}"

General Proximal Incremental Aggregated Gradient Algorithms: Better and Novel Results under General Scheme,"Tao Sun, Yuejiao Sun, Dongsheng Li, Qing Liao","The incremental aggregated gradient algorithm is popular in network optimization

make the stepsize be very small (the strongly convex constant may be small).In this paper, we propose a general proximal incremental aggregated gradient algorithm, which contains various existing algorithms including the basic incremental aggregated gradient method.

(2018b), show that if the inputs are drawn from a concentrated metric probability space, then adversarial examples with small perturbation are inevitable. A concentrated space has the property that any subset with Ω(1) (e.g.,1/100) measure, according to the imposed distribution, has small distance to almost all (e.g.,  99/100) of the points in the space. It is not clear,  however,  whether these theoretical results apply to actual distributions such as images. This paper presents a method for empirically measuring and bounding the concentration of a concrete dataset which is proven to converge to the actual concentration. We use it to empirically estimate the intrinsic robustness to and L2 and Linfinity perturbations of several image classification benchmarks.

Drill-down: Interactive Retrieval of Complex Scenes using Natural Language Queries,"Fuwen Tan, Paola Cascante-Bonilla, Xiaoxiao Guo, Hui Wu, Song Feng, Vicente Ordonez","This paper explores the task of interactive image retrieval using natural language queries, where a user progressively provides input queries to refine a set of retrieval results. Moreover, our work explores this problem in the context of complex image scenes containing multiple objects. We propose Drill-down, an effective framework for encoding multiple queries with an efficient compact state representation that significantly extends current methods for single-round image retrieval.
We show that using multiple rounds of natural language queries as input can be surprisingly effective to find arbitrarily specific images of complex scenes. Furthermore, we find that existing image datasets with textual captions can provide a surprisingly effective form of weak supervision for this task.

Provably Efficient Q-Learning with Low Switching Cost,"Yu Bai, Tengyang Xie, Nan Jiang, Yu-Xiang Wang","We take initial steps in studying PAC-MDP algorithms with limited adaptivity, that is, algorithms that change its exploration policy as infrequently as possible during regret minimization.

Our main contribution, Q-Learning with UCB2 exploration, is a model-free algorithm for $H$-step episodic MDP that achieves sublinear regret whose local switching cost in $K$ episodes is $O(H^3SA\log K)$, and we provide a lower bound of $\Omega(HSA)$ on the local switching cost for any no-regret algorithm.

Fast and Accurate Least-Mean-Squares Solvers,"Alaa Maalouf, Ibrahim Jubran, Dan Feldman","Least-mean squares (LMS) solvers such as Linear / Ridge / Lasso-Regression, SVD and Elastic-Net not only solve fundamental machine learning problems, but are also the building blocks in a variety of other methods, such as decision trees and matrix factorizations.

We suggest an algorithm that gets a finite set of $n$ $d$-dimensional real vectors and returns a weighted subset of $d+1$ vectors whose sum is \emph{exactly} the same. The proof in Caratheodory's Theorem (1907) computes such a subset in $O(n^2d^2)$ time and thus not used in practice. Our algorithm computes this subset in $O(nd)$ time, using $O(\log n)$ calls to Caratheodory's construction on small but ""smart"" subsets. This is based on a novel paradigm of fusion between different data summarization techniques, known as sketches and coresets.

As an example application, we show how it can be used to boost the performance of existing LMS solvers, such as those in scikit-learn library, up to x100. Generalization for streaming and distributed (big) data is trivial.

Graph Agreement Models for Semi-Supervised Learning,"Otilia Stretcu, Krishnamurthy Viswanathan, Dana Movshovitz-Attias, Emmanouil Platanios, Sujith Ravi, Andrew Tomkins","Graph-based algorithms are among the most successful paradigms for solving semi-supervised learning tasks. Recent work on graph convolutional networks and neural graph learning methods has successfully combined the expressiveness of neural networks with graph structures. We propose a technique that, when applied to these methods, achieves state-of-the-art results on semi-supervised learning datasets. Traditional graph-based algorithms, such as label propagation, were designed with the underlying assumption that the label of a node can be imputed from that of the neighboring nodes. However, real-world graphs are either noisy or have edges that do not correspond to label agreement. To address this, we propose Graph Agreement Models (GAM), which introduces an auxiliary model that predicts the probability of two nodes sharing the same label as a learned function of their features. The agreement model is used when training a node classification model by encouraging agreement only for the pairs of nodes it deems likely to have the same label, thus guiding its parameters to better local optima. The classification and agreement models are trained jointly in a co-training fashion. Moreover, GAM can also be applied to any semi-supervised classification problem, by inducing a graph whenever one is not provided. We demonstrate that our method achieves a relative improvement of up to 72% for various node classification models, and obtains state-of-the-art results on multiple established datasets.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/4772c1b987f1f6d8c9d4ef0f3b764f7a-Paper.pdf,2019,"graph, agreement, label, classification, learning, model, models, node, nodes, semi","graph, model, gam, agreement, nodes, classiﬁcation, edges, label, node, labeled","{'agreement': 0.6121880573708609, 'semi': 0.43450216184377816, 'supervised': 0.41467951653084717, 'graph': 0.33849804818446116, 'models': 0.3358021873471064, 'learning': 0.19269279873292258}","{'agreement': 0.44760178600266326, 'graph': 0.3345753654898455, 'label': 0.3189848665086322, 'gam': 0.21454501769702053, 'semi': 0.19446535788889197, 'node': 0.19041360793770723, 'nodes': 0.18852391024543325, 'classification': 0.17530743131482732, 'supervised': 0.1655335797675389, '72': 0.10727250884851026}"

Large Scale Structure of Neural Network Loss Landscapes,"Stanislav Fort, Stanislaw Jastrzebski","There are many surprising and perhaps counter-intuitive properties of optimization of deep neural networks.

Our core idea is to model the loss landscape as a set of high dimensional \emph{wedges} that together form a large-scale, inter-connected structure and towards which optimization is drawn. We first show that hyperparameter choices such as learning rate, network width and $L_2$ regularization, affect the path optimizer takes through the landscape in similar ways, influencing the large scale curvature of the regions the optimizer explores. Finally, we predict and demonstrate new counter-intuitive properties of the loss-landscape.

Model Similarity Mitigates Test Set Overuse,"Horia Mania, John Miller, Ludwig Schmidt, Moritz Hardt, Benjamin Recht","Excessive reuse of test data has become commonplace in today's machine learning workflows. Popular benchmarks, competitions, industrial scale tuning, among other applications, all involve test data reuse beyond guidance by statistical confidence bounds. Nonetheless, recent replication studies give evidence that popular benchmarks continue to support progress despite years of extensive reuse. We proffer a new explanation for the apparent longevity of test data: Many proposed models are similar in their predictions and we prove that this similarity mitigates overfitting. Specifically, we show empirically that models proposed for the ImageNet ILSVRC benchmark agree in their predictions well beyond what we can conclude from their accuracy levels alone. Likewise, models created by large scale hyperparameter search enjoy high levels of similarity.

Explicit Planning for Efficient Exploration in Reinforcement Learning,"Liangpeng Zhang, Ke Tang, Xin Yao","Efficient exploration is crucial to achieving good performance in reinforcement learning. Existing systematic exploration strategies (R-MAX, MBIE, UCRL, etc.), despite being promising theoretically, are essentially greedy strategies that follow some predefined heuristics. When the heuristics do not match the dynamics of Markov decision processes (MDPs) well, an excessive amount of time can be wasted in travelling through already-explored states, lowering the overall efficiency. We argue that explicit planning for exploration can help alleviate such a problem, and propose a Value Iteration for Exploration Cost (VIEC) algorithm which computes the optimal exploration scheme by solving an augmented MDP. We then present a detailed analysis of the exploration behaviour of some popular strategies, showing how these strategies can fail and spend O(n^2 md) or O(n^2 m + nmd) steps to collect sufficient data in some tower-shaped MDPs, while the optimal exploration scheme, which can be obtained by VIEC, only needs O(nmd), where n, m are the numbers of states and actions and d is the data demand.

vGraph: A Generative Model for Joint Community Detection and Node Representation Learning,"Fan-Yun Sun, Meng Qu, Jordan Hoffmann, Chin-Wei Huang, Jian Tang","This paper focuses on two fundamental tasks of graph analysis: community detection and node representation learning, which capture the global and local structures of graphs respectively. In existing literature, these two tasks are usually independently studied while they are actually highly correlated. We propose a probabilistic generative model called vGraph to learn community membership and node representation collaboratively. Specifically, we assume that each node can be represented as a mixture of communities, and each community is defined as a multinomial distribution over nodes. Both the mixing coefficients and the community distribution are parameterized by the low-dimensional representations of the nodes and communities. We designed an effective variational inference algorithm for the optimization through backpropagation, which regularizes the community membership of neighboring nodes to be similar in the latent space. Experimental results on multiple real-world graphs show that vGraph is very effective in both community detection and node representation learning, outperforming many competitive baselines in both tasks.

Can Unconditional Language Models Recover Arbitrary Sentences?,"Nishant Subramani, Samuel Bowman, Kyunghyun Cho","Neural network-based generative language models like ELMo and BERT can work effectively as general purpose sentence encoders in text classification without further fine-tuning. Is it possible to adapt them in a  similar way for use as general-purpose decoders? For this to be possible, it would need to be the case that for any target sentence of interest, there is some continuous representation that can be passed to the language model to cause it to reproduce that sentence. We set aside the difficult problem of designing an encoder that can produce such representations and, instead, ask directly whether such representations exist at all. To do this, we introduce a pair of effective, complementary methods for feeding representations into pretrained unconditional language models and a corresponding set of methods to map sentences into and out of this representation space, the reparametrized sentence space. We then investigate the conditions under which a language model can be made to generate a sentence through the identification of a point in such a space and find that it is possible to recover arbitrary sentences nearly perfectly with language models and representations of moderate size.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/48c8c3963853fff20bd9e8bee9bd4c07-Paper.pdf,2019,"language, sentence, representations, models, possible, space, general, methods, model, purpose","sentence, model, language, space, recoverability, dimension, models, sentences, al, et","{'recover': 0.46474493885068136, 'sentences': 0.46474493885068136, 'unconditional': 0.46474493885068136, 'arbitrary': 0.42219158604468865, 'language': 0.3298540018957697, 'models': 0.25492553333168677}","{'sentence': 0.5102922274390882, 'language': 0.32671708936958194, 'sentences': 0.22699619372986382, 'representations': 0.22623899893513152, 'possible': 0.19342376841130754, 'purpose': 0.17226163912989279, 'space': 0.1470512287867607, 'reparametrized': 0.12493774824204618, 'elmo': 0.11824598116511119, 'passed': 0.11824598116511119}"
A Kernel Loss for Solving the Bellman Equation,"Yihao Feng, Lihong Li, Qiang Liu","Value function learning plays a central role in many state-of-the-art reinforcement 
learning algorithms.  Many popular algorithms like Q-learning do not optimize

convergence guarantees, as can be observed in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel loss function, which can be optimized using standard gradient-based methods with guaranteed convergence. The key advantage is that its gradient can be easily approximated using sampled transitions, avoiding the need for double samples required by prior algorithms like residual gradient.

Non-asymptotic Analysis of Stochastic Methods for Non-Smooth Non-Convex Regularized Problems,"Yi Xu, Rong Jin, Tianbao Yang","Stochastic Proximal Gradient (SPG) methods have been widely used for solving optimization problems with a simple (possibly non-smooth) regularizer in machine learning and statistics. However, to the best of our knowledge no non-asymptotic  convergence analysis of SPG exists for non-convex optimization with a non-smooth and non-convex regularizer. All existing non-asymptotic  analysis of SPG for solving non-smooth non-convex problems require the non-smooth regularizer to be a convex function, and hence are not applicable to a non-smooth non-convex regularized problem. This work initiates the analysis to bridge this gap and opens the door to non-asymptotic convergence analysis of non-smooth non-convex regularized problems. We analyze several variants of mini-batch SPG methods for minimizing a non-convex objective that consists of a smooth non-convex loss and a non-smooth non-convex regularizer. Our contributions are two-fold: (i) we show that they enjoy the same complexities as their counterparts for solving convex regularized non-convex problems in terms of finding an approximate stationary point; (ii) we develop more practical variants using dynamic mini-batch size instead of a fixed mini-batch size without requiring  the target accuracy level of solution.  The significance of our results  is that they improve  upon the-state-of-art results for solving non-smooth non-convex regularized problems.

Learning Robust Options by Conditional Value at Risk Optimization,"Takuya Hiraoka, Takahisa Imagawa, Tatsuya Mori, Takashi Onishi, Yoshimasa Tsuruoka","Options are generally learned by using an inaccurate environment model (or simulator), which contains uncertain model parameters. 
While there are several methods to learn options that are robust against the uncertainty of model parameters, these methods only consider either the worst case or the average (ordinary) case for learning options.

A Generalized Algorithm for Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning and Policy Adaptation,"Runzhe Yang, Xingyuan Sun, Karthik Narasimhan","We introduce a new algorithm for multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) with linear preferences, with the goal of enabling few-shot adaptation to new tasks. In MORL, the aim is to learn policies over multiple competing objectives whose relative importance (preferences) is unknown to the agent. While this alleviates dependence on scalar reward design, the expected return of a policy can change significantly with varying preferences, making it challenging to learn a single model to produce optimal policies under different preference conditions.

Communication trade-offs for Local-SGD with large step size,"Aymeric Dieuleveut, Kumar Kshitij Patel","Synchronous mini-batch SGD is state-of-the-art for large-scale distributed machine learning. However, in practice, its convergence is bottlenecked by slow communication rounds between worker nodes. A natural solution to reduce communication is to use the \emph{``local-SGD''}  model in which the workers train their model independently and synchronize every once in a while. This algorithm improves the computation-communication trade-off but its convergence is not understood very well. We propose a non-asymptotic error analysis, which enables comparison to \emph{one-shot averaging} i.e., a single communication round among independent workers, and \emph{mini-batch averaging} i.e., communicating at every step. We also provide adaptive lower bounds on the communication frequency for large step-sizes ($ t^{-\alpha} $, $ \alpha\in (1/2 , 1 ) $) and show that \emph{Local-SGD} reduces communication by a factor of $O\Big(\frac{\sqrt{T}}{P^{3/2}}\Big)$, with $T$ the total number of gradients and $P$ machines.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/4aadd661908b181d059a117f02fbc9ec-Paper.pdf,2019,"communication, emph, sgd, alpha, averaging, batch, big, convergence, every, large","sgd, wt, averaging, local, communication, mini, number, batch, variance, results","{'offs': 0.4295876612381624, 'size': 0.4065785978559588, 'trade': 0.3902534075828641, 'step': 0.3233678803839584, 'sgd': 0.3191624506334984, 'communication': 0.3152472892022958, 'local': 0.3115849002722675, 'large': 0.3081446146891136}","{'communication': 0.48554753274876467, 'emph': 0.3000196890048212, 'sgd': 0.24138215462600382, 'workers': 0.2151265328244611, 'big': 0.20736376319991928, 'alpha': 0.19101316792147593, 'averaging': 0.19101316792147593, 'mini': 0.18503480132032102, 'every': 0.1609214364173359, 'batch': 0.15207708023788366}"
Towards modular and programmable architecture search,"Renato Negrinho, Matthew Gormley, Geoffrey J.

However, current systems focus on specific use-cases (e.g. convolutional image classifiers and recurrent language models), making them unsuitable for general use-cases that an expert might wish to write.

The language constructs allow us to write modular, composable, and reusable search space encodings and to reason about search space design. We use our language to encode search spaces from the architecture search literature. The language allows us to decouple the implementations of the search space and the search algorithm, allowing us to expose search spaces to search algorithms through a consistent interface.

Large-scale optimal transport map estimation using projection pursuit,"Cheng Meng, Yuan Ke, Jingyi Zhang, Mengrui Zhang, Wenxuan Zhong, Ping Ma","This paper studies the estimation of large-scale optimal transport maps (OTM), which is a well known challenging problem owing to the curse of dimensionality.
Existing literature approximates the large-scale OTM by a series of one-dimensional OTM problems through iterative random projection.
Such methods, however, suffer from slow or none convergence in practice due to the nature of randomly selected projection directions. 
Instead, we propose an estimation method of large-scale OTM by combining the idea of projection pursuit regression and sufficient dimension reduction. 
The proposed method, named projection pursuit Monge map (PPMM), adaptively selects the mostinformative'' projection direction in each iteration. 
We theoretically show the proposed dimension reduction method can consistently estimate the mostinformative'' projection direction in each iteration. 
Furthermore, the PPMM algorithm weakly convergences to the target large-scale OTM in a reasonable number of steps.

Understanding Attention and Generalization in Graph Neural Networks,"Boris Knyazev, Graham W.

We particularly focus on the ability of attention GNNs to generalize to larger, more complex or noisy graphs.

We find that under typical conditions the effect of attention is negligible or even harmful, but under certain conditions it provides an exceptional gain in performance of more than 60% in some of our classification tasks. Satisfying these conditions in practice is challenging and often requires optimal initialization or supervised training of attention.

We propose a new family of prior distributions—Tensor Ring Induced Prior (TRIP)—that packs an exponential number of Gaussians into a high-dimensional lattice with a relatively small number of parameters.

Extending Stein's unbiased risk estimator to train deep denoisers with correlated pairs of noisy images,"Magauiya Zhussip, Shakarim Soltanayev, Se Young Chun","Recently, Stein's unbiased risk estimator (SURE) has been applied to unsupervised training of deep neural network Gaussian denoisers that outperformed classical non-deep learning based denoisers and yielded comparable performance to those trained with ground truth. While SURE requires only one noise realization per image for training, it does not take advantage of having multiple noise realizations per image when they are available (e.g., two uncorrelated noise realizations per image for Noise2Noise). Here, we propose an extended SURE (eSURE) to train deep denoisers with correlated pairs of noise realizations per image and applied it to the case with two uncorrelated realizations per image to achieve better performance than SURE based method and comparable results to Noise2Noise. Then, we further investigated the case with imperfect ground truth (i.e., mild noise in ground truth) that may be obtained considering painstaking, time-consuming, and even expensive processes of collecting ground truth images with multiple noisy images.

Preference-Based Batch and Sequential Teaching: Towards a Unified View of Models,"Farnam Mansouri, Yuxin Chen, Ara Vartanian, Jerry Zhu, Adish Singla","Algorithmic machine teaching studies the interaction between a teacher and a learner where the teacher selects labeled examples aiming at teaching a target hypothesis. In a quest to lower teaching complexity and to achieve more natural teacher-learner interactions, several teaching models and complexity measures have been proposed for both the batch settings (e.g., worst-case, recursive, preference-based, and non-clashing models) as well as the sequential settings (e.g., local preference-based model). To better understand the connections between these different batch and sequential models, we develop a novel framework which captures the teaching process via preference functions $\Sigma$. In our framework, each function $\sigma \in \Sigma$ induces a teacher-learner pair with teaching complexity as $\TD(\sigma)$. We show that the above-mentioned teaching models are equivalent to specific types/families of preference functions in our framework. This equivalence, in turn, allows us to study the differences between two important teaching models, namely $\sigma$ functions inducing the strongest batch (i.e., non-clashing) model and $\sigma$ functions inducing a weak sequential (i.e., local preference-based) model.  Finally, we identify preference functions inducing a novel family of sequential models with teaching complexity linear in the VC dimension of the hypothesis class: this is in contrast to the best known complexity result for the batch models which is quadratic in the VC dimension.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/4dc3ed26a29c9c3df3ec373524377a5b-Paper.pdf,2019,"teaching, models, preference, sigma, complexity, functions, batch, sequential, teacher, based","teaching, preference, hypothesis, learner, functions, models, complexity, h1, set, h0","{'preference': 0.43074780615230757, 'teaching': 0.36823612468370553, 'view': 0.3518668465836625, 'unified': 0.345164922999426, 'batch': 0.3391698480652521, 'sequential': 0.3391698480652521, 'towards': 0.30897679037712666, 'models': 0.2362771598683544, 'based': 0.23354540723069506}","{'teaching': 0.5406287566985044, 'sigma': 0.38450998347739257, 'preference': 0.34849627081154966, 'teacher': 0.2361060995624631, 'inducing': 0.18370864005037307, 'batch': 0.17315622408529102, 'sequential': 0.16786702302119147, 'complexity': 0.16104971589706552, 'functions': 0.15693447149296602, 'models': 0.151666200361747}"
Value Function in Frequency Domain and the Characteristic Value Iteration Algorithm,Amir-massoud Farahmand,"This paper considers the problem of estimating the distribution of returns in reinforcement learning (i.e., distributional RL problem). It presents a new representational framework to maintain the uncertainty of returns and provides mathematical tools to compute it. 
We show that instead of representing a probability distribution function of returns, one can represent their characteristic function instead, the Fourier transform of their distribution. We call the new representation Characteristic Value Function (CVF), which can be interpreted as the frequency domain representation of the probability distribution of returns.

Communication-Efficient Distributed Learning via Lazily Aggregated Quantized Gradients,"Jun Sun, Tianyi Chen, Georgios Giannakis, Zaiyue Yang","The present paper develops a novel aggregated gradient approach for distributed machine learning that adaptively compresses the gradient communication. The key idea is to first quantize the computed gradients, and then skip less informative quantized gradient communications by reusing outdated gradients. Quantizing and skipping result in 'lazy' worker-server communications, which justifies the term Lazily Aggregated Quantized gradient that is henceforth abbreviated as  LAQ. Our LAQ can provably attain the same linear convergence rate as the gradient descent in the strongly convex case, while effecting major savings in the  communication overhead both in transmitted bits as well as in communication rounds.

Twin Auxilary Classifiers GAN,"Mingming Gong, Yanwu Xu, Chunyuan Li, Kun Zhang, Kayhan Batmanghelich","Conditional generative models enjoy significant progress over the past few years. One of the popular conditional models is Auxiliary Classifier GAN (AC-GAN) that generates highly discriminative images by extending the loss function of GAN with an auxiliary classifier. However, the diversity of the generated samples by AC-GAN tends to decrease as the number of classes increases. In this paper, we identify the source of low diversity issue theoretically and propose a practical solution to the problem. We show that the auxiliary classifier in AC-GAN imposes perfect separability, which is disadvantageous when the supports of the class distributions have significant overlap. To address the issue, we propose Twin Auxiliary Classifiers Generative Adversarial Net (TAC-GAN) that adds a new player that interacts with other players (the generator and the discriminator) in GAN. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our TAC-GAN can effectively minimize the divergence between generated and real data distributions.

AutoPrune: Automatic Network Pruning by Regularizing Auxiliary Parameters,"XIA XIAO, Zigeng Wang, Sanguthevar Rajasekaran","Reducing the model redundancy is an important task to deploy complex deep learning models to resource-limited or time-sensitive devices. Directly regularizing or modifying weight values makes pruning procedure less robust and sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, and it also requires prior knowledge to tune different hyperparameters for different models. To build a better generalized and easy-to-use pruning method, we propose AutoPrune, which prunes the network through optimizing a set of trainable auxiliary parameters instead of original weights. The instability and noise during training on auxiliary parameters will not directly affect weight values, which makes pruning process more robust to noise and less sensitive to hyperparameters. Moreover, we design gradient update rules for auxiliary parameters to keep them consistent with pruning tasks. Our method can automatically eliminate network redundancy with recoverability, relieving the complicated prior knowledge required to design thresholding functions, and reducing the time for trial and error. We evaluate our method with LeNet and VGG-like on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, and with AlexNet, ResNet and MobileNet on ImageNet to establish the scalability of our work.

Safe Exploration for Interactive Machine Learning,"Matteo Turchetta, Felix Berkenkamp, Andreas Krause","In interactive machine learning (IML), we iteratively make decisions and obtain noisy observations of an unknown function. While IML methods, e.g., Bayesian optimization and active learning, have been successful in applications, on real-world systems they must provably avoid unsafe decisions. To this end, safe IML algorithms must carefully learn about a priori unknown constraints without making unsafe decisions. Existing algorithms for this problem learn about the safety of all decisions to ensure convergence. This is sample-inefficient, as it explores decisions that are not relevant for the original IML objective. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that renders any existing unsafe IML algorithm safe. Our method works as an add-on that takes suggested decisions as input and exploits regularity assumptions in terms of a Gaussian process prior in order to efficiently learn about their safety. As a result, we only explore the safe set when necessary for the IML problem.

Neuropathic Pain Diagnosis Simulator for Causal Discovery Algorithm Evaluation,"Ruibo Tu, Kun Zhang, Bo Bertilson, Hedvig Kjellstrom, Cheng Zhang","Discovery of causal relations from observational data is essential for many disciplines of science and real-world applications. However, unlike other machine learning algorithms, whose development has been greatly fostered by a large amount of available benchmark datasets, causal discovery algorithms are notoriously difficult to be systematically evaluated because few datasets with known ground-truth causal relations are available. In this work, we handle the problem of evaluating causal discovery algorithms by building a flexible simulator in the medical setting. We develop a neuropathic pain diagnosis simulator, inspired by the fact that the biological processes of neuropathic pathophysiology are well studied with well-understood causal influences. Our simulator exploits the causal graph of the neuropathic pain pathology and its parameters in the generator are estimated from real-life patient cases. We show that the data generated from our simulator have similar statistics as real-world data.

Budgeted Reinforcement Learning in Continuous State Space,"Nicolas Carrara, Edouard Leurent, Romain Laroche, Tanguy Urvoy, Odalric-Ambrym Maillard, Olivier Pietquin","A Budgeted Markov Decision Process (BMDP) is an extension of a Markov Decision Process to critical applications requiring safety constraints. It relies on a notion of risk implemented in the shape of an upper bound on a constrains violation signal that -- importantly -- can be modified in real-time. So far, BMDPs could only be solved in the case of finite state spaces with known dynamics. This work extends the state-of-the-art to continuous spaces environments and unknown dynamics. We show that the solution to a BMDP is the fixed point of a novel Budgeted Bellman Optimality operator.

Parameter elimination in particle Gibbs sampling,"Anna Wigren, Riccardo Sven Risuleo, Lawrence Murray, Fredrik Lindsten","Bayesian inference in state-space models is challenging due to high-dimensional state trajectories. A viable approach is particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC), combining MCMC and sequential Monte Carlo to form ``exact approximations'' to otherwise-intractable MCMC methods. The performance of the approximation is limited to that of the exact method. We focus on particle Gibbs (PG) and particle Gibbs with ancestor sampling (PGAS), improving their performance beyond that of the ideal Gibbs sampler (which they approximate) by marginalizing out one or more parameters. This is possible when the parameter(s) has a conjugate prior relationship with the complete data likelihood. Marginalization yields a non-Markov model for inference, but we show that, in contrast to the general case, the methods still scale linearly in time.

Towards Optimal Off-Policy Evaluation for Reinforcement Learning with Marginalized Importance Sampling,"Tengyang Xie, Yifei Ma, Yu-Xiang Wang","Motivated by the many real-world applications of reinforcement learning (RL) that require safe-policy iterations, we consider the problem of off-policy evaluation (OPE) --- the problem of  evaluating a new policy using the historical data obtained by different behavior policies --- under the model of nonstationary episodic Markov Decision Processes (MDP) with a long horizon and a large action space. Existing importance sampling (IS) methods often suffer from large variance that depends exponentially on the RL horizon $H$. To solve this problem, we consider a marginalized importance sampling (MIS) estimator that recursively estimates the state marginal distribution for the target policy at every step. 
MIS achieves a mean-squared error of 
$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^H\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\left[\frac{d_t^\pi(s_t)^2}{d_t^\mu(s_t)^2} \Var_{\mu}\left[\frac{\pi_t(a_t|s_t)}{\mu_t(a_t|s_t)}\big( V_{t+1}^\pi(s_{t+1}) + r_t\big) \middle| s_t\right]\right]   + \tilde{O}(n^{-1.5})
$$
where $\mu$ and $\pi$ are the logging and target policies, $d_t^{\mu}(s_t)$ and $d_t^{\pi}(s_t)$ are the marginal distribution of the state at $t$th step, $H$ is the horizon, $n$ is the sample size and $V_{t+1}^\pi$ is the value function of the MDP under $\pi$. The result matches the Cramer-Rao lower bound in [Jiang and Li, 2016] up to a multiplicative factor of $H$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first OPE estimation error bound with a polynomial dependence on $H$. Besides theory, we show empirical superiority of our method in time-varying, partially observable, and long-horizon RL environments.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/4ffb0d2ba92f664c2281970110a2e071-Paper.pdf,2019,"s_t, pi, mu, d_t, horizon, policy, frac, problem, rl, a_t","st, state, estimator, dπ, policy, mis, sh, 10, al, et","{'marginalized': 0.4820811422871461, 'importance': 0.3937997336521532, 'evaluation': 0.3628818311614567, 'towards': 0.3457983579202574, 'sampling': 0.3163377633086857, 'policy': 0.3075401321370237, 'optimal': 0.27338740346562856, 'reinforcement': 0.26238050087852494, 'learning': 0.15174024289630977}","{'s_t': 0.4963773351875902, 'pi': 0.3637210789759942, 'mu': 0.30310089914666183, 'd_t': 0.28364419153576587, 'horizon': 0.20345889325051503, 'frac': 0.1509879353241698, 'a_t': 0.14182209576788293, 'v_': 0.14182209576788293, 'policy': 0.13669331347378227, 'mis': 0.13422598935012653}"
Understanding Sparse JL for Feature Hashing,Meena Jagadeesan,"Feature hashing and other random projection schemes are commonly used to reduce the dimensionality of feature vectors. The goal is to efficiently project a high-dimensional feature vector living in R^n into a much lower-dimensional space R^m, while approximately preserving Euclidean norm. These schemes can be constructed using sparse random projections, for example using a sparse Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) transform. A line of work introduced by Weinberger et. al (ICML '09) analyzes the accuracy of sparse JL with sparsity 1 on feature vectors with small linfinity-to-l2 norm ratio. Recently, Freksen, Kamma, and Larsen (NeurIPS '18) closed this line of work by proving a tight tradeoff between linfinity-to-l2 norm ratio and accuracy for sparse JL with sparsity 1. In this paper, we demonstrate the benefits of using sparsity s greater than 1 in sparse JL on feature vectors. Our main result is a tight tradeoff between linfinity-to-l2 norm ratio and accuracy for a general sparsity s, that significantly generalizes the result of Freksen et. al. Our result theoretically demonstrates that sparse JL with s > 1 can have significantly better norm-preservation properties on feature vectors than sparse JL with s = 1; we also empirically demonstrate this finding.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/502cc2c94be1a7c4ca7ef25b8b50bc04-Paper.pdf,2019,"sparse, feature, jl, norm, sparsity, vectors, accuracy, l2, linfinity, ratio","ln, sparse, jl, x1, xn, bound, theorem, distribution, vectors, bounds","{'jl': 0.5415506023206071, 'hashing': 0.4919647070985168, 'feature': 0.42641571909429465, 'understanding': 0.4023453953042393, 'sparse': 0.3478239346025932}","{'jl': 0.5044453891105964, 'sparse': 0.29702641888629205, 'norm': 0.24872600833550226, 'feature': 0.23925599940065911, 'linfinity': 0.23871344256997262, 'l2': 0.21561922376334647, 'sparsity': 0.21312775910505802, 'vectors': 0.2117607624301359, 'freksen': 0.16814846303686548, 'ratio': 0.1655065009860691}"

Dynamic Local Regret for Non-convex Online Forecasting,"Sergul Aydore, Tianhao Zhu, Dean P. Foster","We consider online forecasting problems for non-convex machine learning models.

We introduce a local regret for non-convex models in a dynamic environment. We present an update rule incurring a cost, according to our proposed local regret, which is sublinear in time T.

Multiagent Evaluation under Incomplete Information,"Mark Rowland, Shayegan Omidshafiei, Karl Tuyls, Julien Perolat, Michal Valko, Georgios Piliouras, Remi Munos","This paper investigates the evaluation of learned multiagent strategies in the incomplete information setting, which plays a critical role in ranking and training of agents. Traditionally, researchers have relied on Elo ratings for this purpose, with recent works also using methods based on Nash equilibria. Unfortunately, Elo is unable to handle intransitive agent interactions, and other techniques are restricted to zero-sum, two-player settings or are limited by the fact that the Nash equilibrium is intractable to compute. Recently, a ranking method called $\alpha$-Rank, relying on a new graph-based game-theoretic solution concept, was shown to tractably apply to general games. However, evaluations based on Elo or $\alpha$-Rank typically assume noise-free game outcomes, despite the data often being collected from noisy simulations, making this assumption unrealistic in practice. This paper investigates multiagent evaluation in the incomplete information regime, involving general-sum many-player games with noisy outcomes. We derive sample complexity guarantees required to confidently rank agents in this setting. We propose adaptive algorithms for accurate ranking, provide correctness and sample complexity guarantees, then introduce a means of connecting uncertainties in noisy match outcomes to uncertainties in rankings.

SpiderBoost and Momentum: Faster Variance Reduction Algorithms,"Zhe Wang, Kaiyi Ji, Yi Zhou, Yingbin Liang, Vahid Tarokh","SARAH and SPIDER are two recently developed stochastic variance-reduced algorithms, and SPIDER has been shown to achieve a near-optimal first-order oracle complexity in smooth nonconvex optimization.

In this paper, we propose SpiderBoost as an improved scheme, which allows to use a much larger constant-level stepsize while maintaining the same near-optimal oracle complexity, and can be extended with proximal mapping to handle composite optimization (which is nonsmooth and nonconvex) with provable convergence guarantee. In particular, we show that proximal SpiderBoost achieves an oracle complexity of  O(min{n^{1/2}\epsilon^{-2},\epsilon^{-3}})  in composite nonconvex optimization, improving the state-of-the-art result by a factor of  O(min{n^{1/6},\epsilon^{-1/3}}).

Mixtape: Breaking the Softmax Bottleneck Efficiently,"Zhilin Yang, Thang Luong, Russ R. Salakhutdinov, Quoc V. Le","The softmax bottleneck has been shown to limit the expressiveness of neural lan-

On four benchmarks including language modeling and machine translation, the Mixtape layer substantially improves the efficiency over the MoS layer by 3.5x to 10.5x while obtaining similar performance.

High-Dimensional Optimization in Adaptive Random Subspaces,"Jonathan Lacotte, Mert Pilanci, Marco Pavone","We propose a new randomized optimization method for high-dimensional problems which can be seen as a generalization of coordinate descent to random subspaces.

The adaptive subspace can be efficiently generated by a correlated random matrix ensemble whose statistics mimic the input data. We prove that the improvement in the relative error of the solution can be tightly characterized in terms of the spectrum of the data matrix, and provide probabilistic upper-bounds. We then illustrate the consequences of our theory with data matrices of different spectral decay.

Flexible information routing in neural populations through stochastic comodulation,"Caroline Haimerl, Cristina Savin, Eero Simoncelli","Humans and animals are capable of flexibly switching between a multitude of tasks, each requiring rapid, sensory-informed decision making. Incoming stimuli are processed by a hierarchy of neural circuits consisting of millions of neurons with diverse feature selectivity. At any given moment, only a small subset of these carry task-relevant information.In principle, downstream processing stages could identify the relevant neurons through supervised learning, but this would require many example trials. Such extensive learning periods are inconsistent with the observed flexibility of humans or animals, who can adjust to changes in task parameters or structure almost immediately. 
Here, we propose a novel solution based on functionally-targeted stochastic modulation. It has been observed that trial-to-trial neural activity is modulated by a shared, low-dimensional, stochastic signal that introduces task-irrelevant noise. Counter-intuitively this noise is preferentially targeted towards task-informative neurons, corrupting the encoded signal. However, we hypothesize that this modulation offers a solution to the identification problem, labeling task-informative neurons so as to facilitate decoding. We simulate an encoding population of spiking neurons whose rates are modulated by a shared stochastic signal, and show that a linear decoder with readout weights approximating neuron-specific modulation strength can achieve near-optimal accuracy. Such a decoder allows fast and flexible task-dependent information routing without relying on hardwired knowledge of the task-informative neurons (as in maximum likelihood) or unrealistically many supervised training trials (as in regression).",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/516b38afeee70474b04881a633728b15-Paper.pdf,2019,"task, neurons, informative, modulation, signal, stochastic, animals, decoder, humans, information","neurons, task, modulator, decoder, decoding, encoding, noise, informative, modulation, population","{'comodulation': 0.47094771161019133, 'populations': 0.44572337040143595, 'routing': 0.42782641549692224, 'flexible': 0.41394445879010366, 'information': 0.3308928675485567, 'stochastic': 0.2745479370628056, 'neural': 0.20071575351023715}","{'neurons': 0.36892825870285545, 'task': 0.25836758569294904, 'modulation': 0.24208928529632204, 'informative': 0.20781256985917515, 'modulated': 0.17867907970276603, 'signal': 0.17403798440351428, 'animals': 0.15754853191138785, 'trial': 0.15754853191138785, 'trials': 0.15754853191138785, 'targeted': 0.14211046911256647}"
MarginGAN: Adversarial Training in Semi-Supervised Learning,"Jinhao Dong, Tong Lin","A Margin Generative Adversarial Network (MarginGAN) is proposed for semi-supervised learning problems. Like Triple-GAN, the proposed MarginGAN consists of three components---a generator, a discriminator and a classifier, among which two forms of adversarial training arise. The discriminator is trained as usual to distinguish real examples from fake examples produced by the generator. The new feature is that the classifier attempts to increase the margin of real examples and to decrease the margin of fake examples. On the contrary, the purpose of the generator is yielding realistic and large-margin examples in order to fool the discriminator and the classifier simultaneously. Pseudo labels are used for generated and unlabeled examples in training. Our method is motivated by the success of large-margin classifiers and the recent viewpoint that good semi-supervised learning requires a ``bad'' GAN.

RUBi: Reducing Unimodal Biases for Visual Question Answering,"Remi Cadene, Corentin Dancette, Hedi Ben younes, Matthieu Cord, Devi Parikh","Visual Question Answering (VQA) is the task of answering questions about an
image.
Some VQA models often exploit unimodal biases to provide the correct answer without using the image information.
As a result, they suffer from a huge drop in performance when evaluated on data outside their training set distribution. This critical issue makes them unsuitable for real-world settings.We propose RUBi, a new learning strategy to reduce biases in any VQA model.
It reduces the importance of the most biased examples, i.e. examples that can be correctly classified without looking at the image. 
It implicitly forces the VQA model to use the two input modalities instead of relying on statistical regularities between the question and the answer.
We leverage a question-only model that captures the language biases by identifying when these unwanted regularities are used.
It prevents the base VQA model from learning them by influencing its predictions. This leads to dynamically adjusting the loss in order to compensate for biases.

Learning to Correlate in Multi-Player General-Sum Sequential Games,"Andrea Celli, Alberto Marchesi, Tommaso Bianchi, Nicola Gatti","In the context of multi-player, general-sum games, there is a growing interest in solution concepts involving some form of communication among players, since they can lead to socially better outcomes with respect to Nash equilibria and may be reached through learning dynamics in a decentralized fashion. In this paper, we focus on coarse correlated equilibria (CCEs) in sequential games. First, we complete the picture on the complexity of finding social-welfare-maximizing CCEs by proving that the problem is not in Poly-APX, unless P = NP, in games with three or more players (including chance). Then, we provide simple arguments showing that CFR---working with behavioral strategies---may not converge to a CCE in multi-player, general-sum sequential games. In order to amend this issue, we devise two variants of CFR that provably converge to a CCE. The first one (CFR-S) is a simple stochastic adaptation of CFR which employs sampling to build a correlated strategy, whereas the second variant (called CFR-Jr) enhances CFR with a more involved reconstruction procedure to recover correlated strategies from behavioral ones. Experiments on a rich testbed of multi-player, general-sum sequential games show that both CFR-S and CFR-Jr are dramatically faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms to compute CCEs, with CFR-Jr being also a good heuristic to find socially-optimal CCEs.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/525b8410cc8612283c9ecaf9a319f8ed-Paper.pdf,2019,"cfr, games, cces, correlated, general, jr, multi, player, sequential, sum","cfr, player, games, cce, form, 24h, xt, normal, regret, σi","{'correlate': 0.4508856590295545, 'player': 0.4508856590295545, 'sum': 0.3762701710456344, 'general': 0.3683169426437622, 'sequential': 0.35502634786207565, 'games': 0.3234217371841186, 'multi': 0.2556964974758469, 'learning': 0.1419211278313293}","{'cfr': 0.6276873907990441, 'cces': 0.30709021706596357, 'games': 0.23455850872310394, 'jr': 0.2303176627994727, 'player': 0.15736332656371999, 'cce': 0.15354510853298178, 'socially': 0.15354510853298178, 'correlated': 0.15113259555187525, 'sum': 0.13627479403059534, 'sequential': 0.12893760212738398}"
Learning Sample-Specific Models with Low-Rank Personalized Regression,"Ben Lengerich, Bryon Aragam, Eric P. Xing","Modern applications of machine learning (ML) deal with increasingly heterogeneous datasets comprised of data collected from overlapping latent subpopulations. As a result, traditional models trained over large datasets may fail to recognize highly predictive localized effects in favour of weakly predictive global patterns. This is a problem because localized effects are critical to developing individualized policies and treatment plans in applications ranging from precision medicine to advertising. To address this challenge, we propose to estimate sample-specific models that tailor inference and prediction at the individual level. In contrast to classical ML models that estimate a single, complex model (or only a few complex models), our approach produces a model personalized to each sample. These sample-specific models can be studied to understand subgroup dynamics that go beyond coarse-grained class labels. Crucially, our approach does not assume that relationships between samples (e.g. a similarity network) are known a priori. Instead, we use unmodeled covariates to learn a latent distance metric over the samples. We apply this approach to financial, biomedical, and electoral data as well as simulated data and show that sample-specific models provide fine-grained interpretations of complicated phenomena without sacrificing predictive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models such as deep neural networks.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/52d2752b150f9c35ccb6869cbf074e48-Paper.pdf,2019,"models, sample, approach, data, predictive, specific, applications, complex, datasets, effects","models, sample, model, personalized, regression, speciﬁc, parameters, data, samples, linear","{'personalized': 0.481699285478376, 'specific': 0.43509751652029877, 'rank': 0.37349332886316666, 'sample': 0.3418939786041443, 'low': 0.3365125359980188, 'regression': 0.3246870299145918, 'models': 0.27917849058805194, 'learning': 0.16020051900924037}","{'models': 0.25168856929040495, 'localized': 0.21868908940035262, 'predictive': 0.21652981023989326, 'sample': 0.20330105231931742, 'ml': 0.19277537907675477, 'specific': 0.17841192372623202, 'grained': 0.17312666294180457, 'effects': 0.1576793622866535, 'estimate': 0.13339255711741085, 'electoral': 0.1244021076018748}"
Learning Reward Machines for Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning,"Rodrigo Toro Icarte, Ethan Waldie, Toryn Klassen, Rick Valenzano, Margarita Castro, Sheila McIlraith","Reward Machines (RMs), originally proposed for specifying problems in Reinforcement Learning (RL), provide a structured, automata-based representation of a reward function that allows an agent to decompose problems into subproblems that can be efficiently learned using off-policy learning. Here we show that RMs can be learned from experience, instead of being specified by the user, and that the resulting problem decomposition can be used to effectively solve partially observable RL problems. We pose the task of learning RMs as a discrete optimization problem where the objective is to find an RM that decomposes the problem into a set of subproblems such that the combination of their optimal memoryless policies is an optimal policy for the original problem. We show the effectiveness of this approach on three partially observable domains, where it significantly outperforms A3C, PPO, and ACER, and discuss its advantages, limitations, and broader potential.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/532435c44bec236b471a47a88d63513d-Paper.pdf,2019,"problem, learning, problems, rms, learned, observable, optimal, partially, policy, reward","rm, state, reward, agent, policy, cookie, learning, rms, optimal, rl","{'observable': 0.4670708573642896, 'partially': 0.4670708573642896, 'machines': 0.451915511209666, 'reward': 0.41999405234071363, 'learning': 0.3236670524184691, 'reinforcement': 0.27983322588150084}","{'rms': 0.43135222012707025, 'subproblems': 0.25974750275498826, 'observable': 0.2434734692711858, 'partially': 0.2058144174564901, 'rl': 0.18164508089690504, 'reward': 0.17799377346009815, 'problems': 0.17035668964164358, 'problem': 0.16823806693026314, 'a3c': 0.15192109011759133, 'acer': 0.15192109011759133}"
Addressing Sample Complexity in Visual Tasks Using HER and Hallucinatory GANs,"Himanshu Sahni, Toby Buckley, Pieter Abbeel, Ilya Kuzovkin","Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms typically require millions of environment interactions to learn successful policies in sparse reward settings. Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) was introduced as a technique to increase sample efficiency by reimagining unsuccessful trajectories as successful ones by altering the originally intended goals. However, it cannot be directly applied to visual environments where goal states are often characterized by the presence of distinct visual features. In this work, we show how visual trajectories can be hallucinated to appear successful by altering agent observations using a generative model trained on relatively few snapshots of the goal. 
We then use this model in combination with HER to train RL agents in visual settings.

"Procrastinating with Confidence: Near-Optimal, Anytime, Adaptive Algorithm Configuration","Robert Kleinberg, Kevin Leyton-Brown, Brendan Lucier, Devon Graham","Algorithm configuration methods optimize the performance of a parameterized heuristic algorithm on a given distribution of problem instances. Recent work introduced an algorithm configuration procedure (Structured Procrastination'') that provably achieves near optimal performance with high probability and with nearly minimal runtime in the worst case. It also offers an anytime property: it keeps tightening its optimality guarantees the longer it is run. Unfortunately, Structured Procrastination is not adaptive to characteristics of the parameterized algorithm: it treats every input like the worst case. Follow-up work (LeapsAndBounds'') achieves adaptivity but trades away the anytime property. This paper introduces a new algorithm, ``Structured Procrastination with Confidence'', that preserves the near-optimality and anytime properties of Structured Procrastination while adding adaptivity. In particular, the new algorithm will perform dramatically faster in settings where many algorithm configurations perform poorly. We show empirically both that such settings arise frequently in practice and that the anytime property is useful for finding good configurations quickly.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/538a50fb36b97123adc3627cbdb223bf-Paper.pdf,2019,"algorithm, anytime, procrastination, structured, property, achieves, adaptivity, case, configuration, configurations","conﬁguration, time, conﬁgurations, algorithm, spc, bound, al, et, runtime, instances","{'anytime': 0.42894528265102966, 'configuration': 0.42894528265102966, 'procrastinating': 0.42894528265102966, 'confidence': 0.3503944113182272, 'near': 0.34372053285596643, 'algorithm': 0.28147044012523426, 'adaptive': 0.26210607888124027, 'optimal': 0.24325414700197015}","{'procrastination': 0.4429288306590447, 'anytime': 0.40237302203508923, 'structured': 0.253434842680329, 'algorithm': 0.22811363522898453, 'property': 0.18838814513587127, 'adaptivity': 0.18090860670556688, 'configurations': 0.18090860670556688, 'configuration': 0.17438057960210365, 'worst': 0.14323264587289677, 'parameterized': 0.14224086167440708}"

Correlated Uncertainty for Learning Dense Correspondences from Noisy Labels,"Natalia Neverova, David Novotny, Andrea Vedaldi","Many machine learning methods depend on human supervision to achieve optimal performance. However, in tasks such as DensePose, where the goal is to establish dense visual correspondences between images, the quality of manual annotations is intrinsically limited. We address this issue by augmenting neural network predictors with the ability to output a distribution over labels, thus explicitly and introspectively capturing the aleatoric uncertainty in the annotations.
Compared to previous works, we show that correlated error fields arise naturally in applications such as DensePose and these fields can be modeled by deep networks, leading to a better understanding of the annotation errors.
We show that these models, by understanding uncertainty better, can solve the original DensePose task more accurately, thus setting the new state-of-the-art accuracy in this benchmark.

Total Least Squares Regression in Input Sparsity Time,"Huaian Diao, Zhao Song, David Woodruff, Xin Yang","In the total least squares problem, one is given an $m \times n$ matrix $A$, and an $m \times d$ matrix $B$, and one seeks to ``correct'' both $A$ and $B$, obtaining matrices $\hat{A}$ and $\hat{B}$, so that there exists an $X$ satisfying the equation $\hat{A}X = \hat{B}$. Typically the problem is overconstrained, meaning that $m \gg \max(n,d)$. The cost of the solution $\hat{A}, \hat{B}$ is given by $\|A-\hat{A}\|_F^2 + \|B - \hat{B}\|_F^2$. We give an algorithm for finding a solution $X$ to the linear system $\hat{A}X=\hat{B}$ for which the cost $\|A-\hat{A}\|_F^2 + \|B-\hat{B}\|_F^2$ is at most a multiplicative $(1+\epsilon)$ factor times the optimal cost, up to an additive error $\eta$ that may be an arbitrarily small function of $n$. Importantly, our running time is $\tilde{O}(\nnz(A) + \nnz(B)) + \poly(n/\epsilon) \cdot d$, where for a matrix $C$, $\nnz(C)$ denotes its number of non-zero entries. Importantly, our running time does not directly depend on the large parameter $m$. As total least squares regression is known to be solvable via low rank approximation, a natural approach is to invoke fast algorithms for approximate low rank approximation, obtaining matrices $\hat{A}$ and $\hat{B}$ from this low rank approximation, and then solving for $X$ so that $\hat{A}X = \hat{B}$. However, existing algorithms do not apply since in total least squares the rank of the low rank approximation needs to be $n$, and so the running time of known methods would be at least $mn^2$. In contrast, we are able to achieve a much faster running time for finding $X$ by never explicitly forming the equation $\hat{A} X = \hat{B}$, but instead solving for an $X$ which is a solution to an implicit such equation.
Finally, we generalize our algorithm to the total least squares problem with regularization.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/540ae6b0f6ac6e155062f3dd4f0b2b01-Paper.pdf,2019,"hat, least, rank, _f, approximation, low, running, squares, time, total","matrix, least, ftls, squares, algorithm, time, total, rm, problem, rank","{'sparsity': 0.4455300923597289, 'total': 0.42764089807228434, 'input': 0.3928418038104195, 'least': 0.3845383005515103, 'squares': 0.3845383005515103, 'regression': 0.3003073635083231, 'time': 0.2799599873507461}","{'hat': 0.8263676134525506, '_f': 0.18979566860491368, 'rank': 0.15080872482709295, 'least': 0.14810160392323776, 'squares': 0.14274722521206376, 'nnz': 0.1377279355754251, 'running': 0.13609152081191725, 'total': 0.12766345374585691, 'equation': 0.11121407241614366, 'approximation': 0.09783191396916376}"
Bayesian Learning of Sum-Product Networks,"Martin Trapp, Robert Peharz, Hong Ge, Franz Pernkopf, Zoubin Ghahramani","Sum-product networks (SPNs) are flexible density estimators and have received significant attention due to their attractive inference properties. While parameter learning in SPNs is well developed, structure learning leaves something to be desired: Even though there is a plethora of SPN structure learners, most of them are somewhat ad-hoc and based on intuition rather than a clear learning principle. In this paper, we introduce a well-principled Bayesian framework for SPN structure learning. First, we decompose the problem into i) laying out a computational graph, and ii) learning the so-called scope function over the graph. The first is rather unproblematic and akin to neural network architecture validation. The second represents the effective structure of the SPN and needs to respect the usual structural constraints in SPN, i.e. completeness and decomposability. While representing and learning the scope function is somewhat involved in general, in this paper, we propose a natural parametrisation for an important and widely used special case of SPNs. These structural parameters are incorporated into a Bayesian model, such that simultaneous structure and parameter learning is cast into monolithic Bayesian posterior inference. In various experiments, our Bayesian SPNs often improve test likelihoods over greedy SPN learners. Further, since the Bayesian framework protects against overfitting, we can evaluate hyper-parameters directly on the Bayesian model score, waiving the need for a separate validation set, which is especially beneficial in low data regimes. Bayesian SPNs can be applied to heterogeneous domains and can easily be extended to nonparametric formulations. Moreover, our Bayesian approach is the first, which consistently and robustly learns SPN structures under missing data.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/5421e013565f7f1afa0cfe8ad87a99ab-Paper.pdf,2019,"bayesian, learning, spn, spns, structure, first, data, framework, function, graph","spn, structure, learning, bayesian, spns, scope, sum, function, graph, set","{'product': 0.5943012311102436, 'sum': 0.5801451705717341, 'bayesian': 0.41781614843639264, 'networks': 0.29628664885858025, 'learning': 0.21881845346559173}","{'spn': 0.4986267200215951, 'spns': 0.41552226668466263, 'bayesian': 0.3221529414705391, 'structure': 0.17853822273719025, 'scope': 0.15730662289475636, 'somewhat': 0.14208806825555523, 'learners': 0.13577179739546272, 'learning': 0.12772414663748302, 'validation': 0.12348502240090109, 'structural': 0.10099127885515605}"

Alternative unsupervised approaches rely on careful selection of multiple handcrafted saliency methods to generate noisy pseudo-ground-truth labels. In this work, we propose a two-stage mechanism for robust unsupervised object saliency prediction, where the first stage involves refinement of the noisy pseudo labels generated from different handcrafted methods. Each handcrafted method is substituted by a deep network that learns to generate the pseudo labels. These labels are refined incrementally in multiple iterations via our proposed self-supervision technique.

Policy Optimization Provably Converges to Nash Equilibria in Zero-Sum Linear Quadratic Games,"Kaiqing Zhang, Zhuoran Yang, Tamer Basar","We study the global convergence of policy optimization for finding the Nash equilibria (NE) in zero-sum linear quadratic (LQ) games. To this end, we first investigate the landscape of LQ games, viewing it as a nonconvex-nonconcave saddle-point problem in the policy space. Specifically, we show that despite its nonconvexity and nonconcavity, zero-sum LQ games have the property that the stationary point of the objective function with respect to the linear feedback control policies constitutes the NE of the game. Building upon this, we develop three projected nested-gradient methods that are guaranteed to converge to the NE of the game. Moreover, we show that all these algorithms enjoy both globally sublinear and locally linear convergence rates. Simulation results are also provided to illustrate the satisfactory convergence properties of the algorithms.

On the Power and Limitations of Random Features for Understanding Neural Networks,"Gilad Yehudai, Ohad Shamir","Recently, a spate of papers have provided positive theoretical results for training over-parameterized neural networks (where the network size is larger than what is needed to achieve low error). The key insight is that with sufficient over-parameterization, gradient-based methods will implicitly leave some components of the network relatively unchanged, so the optimization dynamics will behave as if those components are essentially fixed at their initial random values. In fact, fixing these \emph{explicitly} leads to the well-known approach of learning with random features (e.g. \citep{rahimi2008random,rahimi2009weighted}). In other words, these techniques imply that we can successfully learn with neural networks, whenever we can successfully learn with random features. In this paper, we formalize the link between existing results and random features, and argue that despite the impressive positive results, random feature approaches are also inherently limited in what they can explain. In particular, we prove that random features cannot be used to learn \emph{even a single ReLU neuron} (over standard Gaussian inputs in $\reals^d$ and $\text{poly}(d)$ weights), unless the network size (or magnitude of its weights) is exponentially large in $d$. Since a single neuron \emph{is} known to be learnable with gradient-based methods, we conclude that we are still far from a satisfying general explanation for the empirical success of neural networks. For completeness we also provide a simple self-contained proof, using a random features technique, that one-hidden-layer neural networks can learn low-degree polynomials.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/5481b2f34a74e427a2818014b8e103b0-Paper.pdf,2019,"random, features, learn, networks, neural, emph, network, results, also, based","random, features, networks, neural, linear, rd, functions, exp, cd, theorem","{'limitations': 0.48258557413030057, 'power': 0.43394501644548794, 'features': 0.4256797696107412, 'understanding': 0.39467482278702765, 'random': 0.37324512624137046, 'networks': 0.22640613958403538, 'neural': 0.22640613958403538}","{'random': 0.37389237770137657, 'features': 0.26511122605112725, 'emph': 0.1963868154561592, 'learn': 0.178846263702433, 'neuron': 0.1730155318116942, 'successfully': 0.14865450371126937, 'components': 0.14208948797085766, 'networks': 0.14155384300671942, 'neural': 0.1393396851275295, 'positive': 0.13740912958259954}"
Real-Time Reinforcement Learning,"Simon Ramstedt, Chris Pal","Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), the mathematical framework underlying most algorithms in Reinforcement Learning (RL), are often used in a way that wrongfully assumes that the state of an agent's environment does not change during action selection. As RL systems based on MDPs begin to find application in real-world safety critical situations, this mismatch between the assumptions underlying classical MDPs and the reality of real-time computation may lead to undesirable outcomes. 
In this paper, we introduce a new framework, in which states and actions evolve simultaneously and show how it is related to the classical MDP formulation. We analyze existing algorithms under the new real-time formulation and show why they are suboptimal when used in real-time.

Streaming Bayesian Inference for Crowdsourced Classification,"Edoardo Manino, Long Tran-Thanh, Nicholas Jennings","A key challenge in crowdsourcing is inferring the ground truth from noisy and unreliable data.

In this paper, we revisit the problem of binary classification from crowdsourced data. Specifically we propose Streaming Bayesian Inference for Crowdsourcing (SBIC), a new algorithm that does not suffer from any of these limitations.

Disentangling Influence: Using disentangled representations to audit model predictions,"Charles Marx, Richard Phillips, Sorelle Friedler, Carlos Scheidegger, Suresh Venkatasubramanian","Motivated by the need to audit complex and black box models, there has been extensive research on quantifying how data features influence model predictions. Feature influence can be direct (a direct influence on model outcomes) and indirect (model outcomes are influenced via proxy features). Feature influence can also be expressed in aggregate over the training or test data or locally with respect to a single point. Current research has typically focused on one of each of these dimensions. In this paper, we develop disentangled influence audits, a procedure to audit the indirect influence of features. Specifically, we show that disentangled representations provide a mechanism to identify proxy features in the dataset, while allowing an explicit computation of feature influence on either individual outcomes or aggregate-level outcomes. We show through both theory and experiments that disentangled influence audits can both detect proxy features and show, for each individual or in aggregate, which of these proxy features affects the classifier being audited the most.

Demystifying Black-box Models with Symbolic Metamodels,"Ahmed M.

However, the black-box nature of most highly-accurate (complex) models is a major hindrance to their interpretability. To address this issue, we introduce the symbolic metamodeling framework — a general methodology for interpreting predictions by converting ""black-box"" models into ""white-box"" functions that are understandable to human subjects. A symbolic metamodel is a model of a model, i.e., a surrogate model of a trained (machine learning) model expressed through a succinct symbolic expression that comprises familiar mathematical functions and can be subjected to symbolic manipulation. We parameterize symbolic metamodels using Meijer G-functions — a class of complex-valued contour integrals that depend on scalar parameters, and whose solutions reduce to familiar elementary, algebraic, analytic and closed-form functions for different parameter settings. This parameterization enables efficient optimization of metamodels via gradient descent, and allows discovering the functional forms learned by a machine learning model with minimal a priori assumptions. We show that symbolic metamodeling provides an all-encompassing framework for model interpretation — all common forms of global and local explanations of a model can be analytically derived from its symbolic metamodel.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/567b8f5f423af15818a068235807edc0-Paper.pdf,2019,"model, symbolic, functions, box, learning, machine, black, complex, familiar, forms","model, symbolic, functions, metamodel, metamodeling, feature, x2, expressions, function, x1","{'demystifying': 0.4665198527211228, 'metamodels': 0.4665198527211228, 'symbolic': 0.4415326712239206, 'black': 0.3988168023154052, 'box': 0.3810881149040921, 'models': 0.25589912298746453}","{'symbolic': 0.5581005364102986, 'model': 0.23128373732955085, 'familiar': 0.19899438181784512, 'metamodel': 0.19899438181784512, 'metamodeling': 0.19899438181784512, 'metamodels': 0.19899438181784512, 'box': 0.18677824032229406, 'functions': 0.16663495282940746, 'forms': 0.13846724116019574, 'black': 0.13260155517172248}"
SHE: A Fast and Accurate Deep Neural Network for Encrypted Data,"Qian Lou, Lei Jiang","Homomorphic Encryption (HE) is one of the most promising security solutions to emerging Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS). Several Leveled-HE (LHE)-enabled Convolutional Neural Networks (LHECNNs) are proposed to implement MLaaS to avoid the large bootstrapping overhead. However, prior LHECNNs have to pay significant computational overhead but achieve only low inference accuracy, due to their polynomial approximation activations and poolings. Stacking many polynomial approximation activation layers in a network greatly reduces the inference accuracy, since the polynomial approximation activation errors lead to a low distortion of the output distribution of the next batch normalization layer. So the polynomial approximation activations and poolings have become the obstacle to a fast and accurate LHECNN model.In this paper, we propose a Shift-accumulation-based LHE-enabled deep neural network (SHE) for fast and accurate inferences on encrypted data. We use the binary-operation-friendly leveled-TFHE (LTFHE) encryption scheme to implement ReLU activations and max poolings. We also adopt the logarithmic quantization to accelerate inferences by replacing expensive LTFHE multiplications with cheap LTFHE shifts. We propose a mixed bitwidth accumulator to expedite accumulations. Since the LTFHE ReLU activations, max poolings, shifts and accumulations have small multiplicative depth, SHE can implement much deeper network architectures with more convolutional and activation layers. Our experimental results show SHE achieves the state-of-the-art inference accuracy and reduces the inference latency by 76.21% ~ 94.23% over prior LHECNNs on MNIST and CIFAR-10.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/56a3107cad6611c8337ee36d178ca129-Paper.pdf,2019,"activations, approximation, inference, ltfhe, polynomial, poolings, accuracy, activation, implement, lhecnns","3k, inference, accuracy, tfhe, md, overhead, ht, fcn, latency, layer","{'encrypted': 0.5489700056319388, 'accurate': 0.44275031987107033, 'fast': 0.3751405076492587, 'network': 0.33979160739008774, 'data': 0.3334027995379178, 'deep': 0.2722967558904361, 'neural': 0.24720922359465927}","{'ltfhe': 0.3284944785384251, 'poolings': 0.3284944785384251, 'lhecnns': 0.24637085890381882, 'activations': 0.22251321289798606, 'polynomial': 0.1888171399298376, 'accumulations': 0.16424723926921256, 'leveled': 0.16424723926921256, 'lhe': 0.16424723926921256, 'mlaas': 0.16424723926921256, 'activation': 0.16417126323467757}"
Non-Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning,"Xiangyuan Zhang, Kaiqing Zhang, Erik Miehling, Tamer Basar","Making decisions in the presence of a strategic opponent requires one to take into account the opponent’s ability to actively mask its intended objective. To describe such strategic situations, we introduce the non-cooperative inverse reinforcement learning (N-CIRL) formalism. The N-CIRL formalism consists of two agents with completely misaligned objectives, where only one of the agents knows the true objective function. Formally, we model the N-CIRL formalism as a zero-sum Markov game with one-sided incomplete information. Through interacting with the more informed player, the less informed player attempts to both infer and optimize the true objective function. As a result of the one-sided incomplete information, the multi-stage game can be decomposed into a sequence of single- stage games expressed by a recursive formula. Solving this recursive formula yields the value of the N-CIRL game and the more informed player’s equilibrium strategy. Another recursive formula, constructed by forming an auxiliary game, termed the dual game, yields the less informed player’s strategy. Building upon these two recursive formulas, we develop a computationally tractable algorithm to approximately solve for the equilibrium strategies. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of our N-CIRL formalism over the existing multi-agent IRL formalism via extensive numerical simulation in a novel cyber security setting.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/56bd37d3a2fda0f2f41925019c81011d-Paper.pdf,2019,"cirl, formalism, game, informed, one, player, recursive, formula, objective, agents","game, attacker, cirl, information, state, value, one, function, reward, defender","{'cooperative': 0.6003481736773219, 'inverse': 0.5012257487389187, 'non': 0.451597752305324, 'reinforcement': 0.3717450760707574, 'learning': 0.21498811058600567}","{'cirl': 0.41682845158264503, 'formalism': 0.3786624670242401, 'informed': 0.2850694378035764, 'game': 0.2547021156993338, 'recursive': 0.2447072879981423, 'player': 0.227836670275901, 'formula': 0.1937770934419687, 'opponent': 0.166731380633058, 'sided': 0.1425347189017882, 'incomplete': 0.13128391190697897}"
Competitive Gradient Descent,"Florian Schaefer, Anima Anandkumar","We introduce a new algorithm for the numerical computation of Nash equilibria of competitive two-player games. Our method is a natural generalization of gradient descent to the two-player setting where the update is given by the Nash equilibrium of a regularized bilinear local approximation of the underlying game.  It avoids oscillatory and divergent behaviors seen in alternating gradient descent. Using numerical experiments and rigorous analysis, we provide a detailed comparison to methods based on \emph{optimism} and \emph{consensus}  and show that our method avoids making any unnecessary changes to the gradient dynamics while achieving exponential (local) convergence for (locally) convex-concave zero sum games. Convergence and stability properties of our method are robust to strong interactions between the players, without adapting the stepsize, which is not the case with previous methods. In our numerical experiments on non-convex-concave problems, existing methods are prone to divergence and instability due to their sensitivity to interactions among the players, whereas we never observe divergence of our algorithm.

Learning in Generalized  Linear Contextual Bandits with Stochastic Delays,"Zhengyuan Zhou, Renyuan Xu, Jose Blanchet","In this paper, we consider online learning in generalized linear contextual bandits where rewards are not immediately observed. Instead, rewards are available to the decision maker only after some delay, which is unknown and stochastic, even though a decision must be made at each time step for an incoming set of contexts. We study the performance of upper confidence bound (UCB) based algorithms adapted to this delayed setting. In particular, we design a delay-adaptive algorithm, which we call Delayed UCB, for generalized linear contextual bandits using UCB-style exploration and establish regret bounds under various delay assumptions. In the important special case of linear contextual bandits, we further modify this algorithm and establish a tighter regret bound under the same delay assumptions.

Arbicon-Net: Arbitrary Continuous Geometric Transformation Networks for Image Registration,"Jianchun Chen, Lingjing Wang, Xiang Li, Yi Fang","This paper concerns the undetermined problem of estimating geometric transformation between image pairs. Recent methods introduce deep neural networks to predict the controlling parameters of hand-crafted geometric transformation models (e.g. thin-plate spline) for image registration and matching. However, the low-dimension parametric models are incapable of estimating a highly complex geometric transform with limited flexibility to model the actual geometric deformation from image pairs. To address this issue, we present an end-to-end trainable deep neural networks, named Arbitrary Continuous Geometric Transformation Networks (Arbicon-Net), to directly predict the dense displacement field for pairwise image alignment. Arbicon-Net is generalized from training data to predict the desired arbitrary continuous geometric transformation in a data-driven manner for unseen new pair of images. Particularly, without imposing penalization terms, the predicted displacement vector function is proven to be spatially continuous and smooth. To verify the performance of Arbicon-Net, we conducted semantic alignment tests over both synthetic and real image dataset with various experimental settings. The results demonstrate that Arbicon-Net outperforms the previous image alignment techniques in identifying the image correspondences.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/56f9f88906aebf4ad985aaec7fa01313-Paper.pdf,2019,"image, geometric, arbicon, net, transformation, alignment, continuous, networks, predict, arbitrary","image, transformation, geometric, arbicon, net, displacement, function, dataset, feature, network","{'arbicon': 0.41023263359816087, 'arbitrary': 0.37267058067251774, 'registration': 0.37267058067251774, 'net': 0.3605783005341072, 'geometric': 0.35069818826091315, 'transformation': 0.35069818826091315, 'continuous': 0.28545419468282096, 'image': 0.256699138023516, 'networks': 0.174839265882871}","{'arbicon': 0.4002989918057004, 'geometric': 0.34673750357941246, 'image': 0.28833055645743766, 'net': 0.28713575765860566, 'transformation': 0.2571016812661235, 'alignment': 0.2051266288209937, 'displacement': 0.18942932665061546, 'predict': 0.1702566628002708, 'continuous': 0.15246776620715047, 'pairs': 0.12944717021755398}"
On the Calibration of Multiclass Classification  with Rejection,"Chenri Ni, Nontawat Charoenphakdee, Junya Honda, Masashi Sugiyama","We investigate the problem of multiclass classification with rejection, where a classifier can choose not to make a prediction to avoid critical misclassification. First, we consider an approach based on simultaneous training of a classifier and a rejector, which achieves the state-of-the-art performance in the binary case. We analyze this approach for the multiclass case and derive a general condition for calibration to the Bayes-optimal solution, which suggests that calibration is hard to achieve by general loss functions unlike the binary case. Next, we consider another traditional approach based on confidence scores, in which the existing work focuses on a specific class of losses.

Point-Voxel CNN for Efficient 3D Deep Learning,"Zhijian Liu, Haotian Tang, Yujun Lin, Song Han","We present Point-Voxel CNN (PVCNN) for efficient, fast 3D deep learning. Previous work processes 3D data using either voxel-based or point-based NN models. However, both approaches are computationally inefficient. The computation cost and memory footprints of the voxel-based models grow cubically with the input resolution, making it memory-prohibitive to scale up the resolution. As for point-based networks, up to 80% of the time is wasted on dealing with the sparse data which have rather poor memory locality, not on the actual feature extraction. In this paper, we propose PVCNN that represents the 3D input data in points to reduce the memory consumption, while performing the convolutions in voxels to reduce the irregular, sparse data access and improve the locality. Our PVCNN model is both memory and computation efficient. Evaluated on semantic and part segmentation datasets, it achieves much higher accuracy than the voxel-based baseline with 10× GPU memory reduction; it also outperforms the state-of-the-art point-based models with 7× measured speedup on average. Remarkably, the narrower version of PVCNN achieves 2× speedup over PointNet (an extremely efficient model) on part and scene segmentation benchmarks with much higher accuracy. We validate the general effectiveness of PVCNN on 3D object detection: by replacing the primitives in Frustrum PointNet with PVConv, it outperforms Frustrum PointNet++ by 2.4% mAP on average with 1.5× measured speedup and GPU memory reduction.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/5737034557ef5b8c02c0e46513b98f90-Paper.pdf,2019,"memory, based, pvcnn, 3d, data, point, voxel, efficient, models, pointnet","based, point, memory, voxel, pvcnn, 3d, points, pointnet, gb, models","{'voxel': 0.5393393659726768, 'cnn': 0.48995593776546914, '3d': 0.39578714293823647, 'point': 0.362301627692782, 'efficient': 0.2970202865238212, 'deep': 0.2531912460340715, 'learning': 0.1697628868201796}","{'pvcnn': 0.42756298588460995, 'voxel': 0.34205038870768795, 'memory': 0.31975239961037316, 'pointnet': 0.24279741945339037, '3d': 0.20557580371884593, 'speedup': 0.1931062955732682, 'frustrum': 0.17102519435384397, 'point': 0.15378419151989184, 'locality': 0.14620539882649775, 'based': 0.13724644364323157}"
Importance Weighted Hierarchical Variational Inference,"Artem Sobolev, Dmitry P. Vetrov","Variational Inference is a powerful tool in the Bayesian modeling toolkit, however, its effectiveness is determined by the expressivity of the utilized variational distributions in terms of their ability to match the true posterior distribution. In turn, the expressivity of the variational family is largely limited by the requirement of having a tractable density function.
To overcome this roadblock, we introduce a new family of variational upper bounds on a marginal log-density in the case of hierarchical models (also known as latent variable models). We then derive a family of increasingly tighter variational lower bounds on the otherwise intractable standard evidence lower bound for hierarchical variational distributions, enabling the use of more expressive approximate posteriors.

Fast Convergence of Belief Propagation to Global Optima: Beyond Correlation Decay,Frederic Koehler,"Belief propagation is a fundamental message-passing algorithm for probabilistic reasoning and inference in graphical models. While it is known to be exact on trees, in most applications belief propagation is run on graphs with cycles. Understanding the behavior ofloopy'' belief propagation has been a major challenge for researchers in machine learning, and several positive convergence results for BP are known under strong assumptions which imply the underlying graphical model exhibits decay of correlations. We show that under a natural initialization, BP converges quickly to the global optimum of the Bethe free energy for Ising models on arbitrary graphs, as long as the Ising model is \emph{ferromagnetic} (i.e. neighbors prefer to be aligned). This holds even though such models can exhibit long range correlations and may have multiple suboptimal BP fixed points.

ZO-AdaMM: Zeroth-Order Adaptive Momentum Method for Black-Box Optimization,"Xiangyi Chen, Sijia Liu, Kaidi Xu, Xingguo Li, Xue Lin, Mingyi Hong, David Cox","The adaptive momentum method (AdaMM), which uses past gradients to update descent directions and learning rates simultaneously, has become one of the most popular first-order optimization methods for solving machine learning  problems. However,  AdaMM is not suited for solving black-box optimization problems, where explicit gradient forms are difficult or infeasible to obtain. In this paper, we propose a zeroth-order  AdaMM (ZO-AdaMM) algorithm, that generalizes AdaMM to the gradient-free regime. We show that the convergence rate of ZO-AdaMM for  both  convex and nonconvex optimization is roughly a factor of $O(\sqrt{d})$ worse than that of the first-order AdaMM algorithm, where $d$ is problem size. In particular, we provide a deep understanding on why  Mahalanobis distance matters in convergence of ZO-AdaMM and other AdaMM-type methods. As a byproduct, our analysis   makes the first step toward understanding adaptive learning rate methods for nonconvex constrained optimization.Furthermore, we demonstrate two applications, designing  per-image and universal adversarial attacks from black-box neural networks, respectively.

We propose U-Time, a fully feed-forward deep learning approach to physiological time series segmentation developed for the analysis of sleep data. U-Time is a temporal fully convolutional network based on the U-Net architecture that was originally proposed for image segmentation. U-Time maps sequential inputs of arbitrary length to sequences of class labels on a freely chosen temporal scale. This is done by implicitly classifying every individual time-point of the input signal and aggregating these classifications over fixed intervals to form the final predictions. We evaluated U-Time for sleep stage classification on a large collection of sleep electroencephalography (EEG) datasets.

VIREL: A Variational Inference Framework for Reinforcement Learning,"Matthew Fellows, Anuj Mahajan, Tim G. J. Rudner, Shimon Whiteson","Applying probabilistic models to reinforcement learning (RL) enables the uses of powerful optimisation tools such as variational inference in RL. However, existing inference frameworks and their algorithms pose significant challenges for learning optimal policies, e.g., the lack of mode capturing behaviour in pseudo-likelihood methods, difficulties learning deterministic policies in maximum entropy RL based approaches, and a lack of analysis when function approximators are used. We propose VIREL, a theoretically grounded probabilistic inference framework for RL that utilises a parametrised action-value function to summarise future dynamics of the underlying MDP, generalising existing approaches. VIREL also benefits from a mode-seeking form of KL divergence, the ability to learn deterministic optimal polices naturally from inference, and the ability to optimise value functions and policies in separate, iterative steps. In applying variational expectation-maximisation to VIREL, we thus show that the actor-critic algorithm can be reduced to expectation-maximisation, with policy improvement equivalent to an E-step and policy evaluation to an M-step. We then derive a family of actor-critic methods fromVIREL, including a scheme for adaptive exploration.

"What Can ResNet Learn Efficiently, Going Beyond Kernels?","Zeyuan Allen-Zhu, Yuanzhi Li","How can neural networks such as ResNet \emph{efficiently} learn CIFAR-10 with test accuracy more than $96 \%$, while other methods, especially kernel methods, fall relatively behind? Can we more provide theoretical justifications for this gap?

Recently, there is an influential line of work relating neural networks to kernels in the over-parameterized regime, proving they can learn certain concept class that is also learnable by kernels with similar test error. Yet, can neural networks provably learn some concept class \emph{better} than kernels?


We answer this positively in the distribution-free setting. We prove neural networks can efficiently learn a notable class of functions, including those defined by three-layer residual networks with smooth activations, without any distributional assumption.
At the same time, we prove there are simple functions in this class such that with the same number of training examples, the test error obtained by neural networks can be \emph{much smaller} than \emph{any} kernel method, including neural tangent kernels (NTK).

The main intuition is that \emph{multi-layer} neural networks can implicitly perform hierarchal learning using different layers, which reduces the sample complexity comparing to ``one-shot'' learning algorithms such as kernel methods.

In the end, we also prove a computation complexity advantage of ResNet with respect to other learning methods including linear regression over arbitrary feature mappings.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/5857d68cd9280bc98d079fa912fd6740-Paper.pdf,2019,"networks, neural, emph, class, kernels, learn, methods, including, kernel, learning","kernel, networks, neural, learn, learning, layer, training, complexity, error, function","{'resnet': 0.47643276518633854, 'going': 0.4509146400615726, 'learn': 0.3975895761117069, 'efficiently': 0.38918571911652544, 'kernels': 0.375142081453623, 'beyond': 0.34556219608161887}","{'emph': 0.3298042609959294, 'kernels': 0.29549276020146464, 'networks': 0.24960592949838875, 'neural': 0.24570164174644726, 'class': 0.19623169508418223, 'kernel': 0.1920869101667195, 'learn': 0.18020841071817725, 'test': 0.16563473805212406, 'resnet': 0.15823825274517941, 'concept': 0.15557627211129138}"

Focused Quantization for Sparse CNNs,"Yiren Zhao, Xitong Gao, Daniel Bates, Robert Mullins, Cheng-Zhong Xu","Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are powerful tools for a wide range of vision tasks, but the enormous amount of memory and compute resources required by CNNs poses a challenge in deploying them on constrained devices. Existing compression techniques, while excelling at reducing model sizes, struggle to be computationally friendly. In this paper, we attend to the statistical properties of sparse CNNs and present focused quantization, a novel quantization strategy based on power-of-two values, which exploits the weight distributions after fine-grained pruning. The proposed method dynamically discovers the most effective numerical representation for weights in layers with varying sparsities, significantly reducing model sizes. Multiplications in quantized CNNs are replaced with much cheaper bit-shift operations for efficient inference. Coupled with lossless encoding, we build a compression pipeline that provides CNNs with high compression ratios (CR), low computation cost and minimal loss in accuracies. In ResNet-50, we achieved a 18.08x CR with only 0.24% loss in top-5 accuracy, outperforming existing compression methods.

Submodular Function Minimization with Noisy Evaluation Oracle,Shinji Ito,"This paper considers submodular function minimization with \textit{noisy evaluation oracles} that return the function value of a submodular objective with zero-mean additive noise. For this problem, we provide an algorithm that returns an $O(n^{3/2}/\sqrt{T})$-additive approximate solution in expectation, where $n$ and $T$ stand for the size of the problem and the number of oracle calls, respectively. There is no room for reducing this error bound by a factor smaller than $O(1/\sqrt{n})$. Indeed, we show that any algorithm will suffer additive errors of $\Omega(n/\sqrt{T})$ in the worst case. Further, we consider an extended problem setting with \textit{multiple-point feedback} in which we can get the feedback of $k$ function values with each oracle call. Under the additional assumption that each noisy oracle is submodular and that $2 \leq k = O(1)$, we provide an algorithm with an $O(n/\sqrt{T})$-additive error bound as well as a worst-case analysis including a lower bound of $\Omega(n/\sqrt{T})$, which together imply that the algorithm achieves an optimal error bound up to a constant.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/58d2d622ed4026cae2e56dffc5818a11-Paper.pdf,2019,"sqrt, additive, algorithm, bound, error, function, oracle, problem, submodular, case","algorithm, ft, submodular, xt, function, gt, oracle, additive, feedback, theorem","{'oracle': 0.46004673394927853, 'submodular': 0.4451193040093124, 'noisy': 0.3987504714127382, 'minimization': 0.39237459353853843, 'evaluation': 0.3811993293182285, 'function': 0.3632535189117725}","{'sqrt': 0.37220099114072264, 'additive': 0.355473601993036, 'submodular': 0.31590680967579005, 'oracle': 0.25978368795531315, 'bound': 0.22723332886959968, 'textit': 0.18114534113680084, 'omega': 0.16917779105642905, 'error': 0.1678972848241308, 'worst': 0.16674411469643907, 'feedback': 0.1655895302988721}"
Knowledge Extraction with No Observable Data,"Jaemin Yoo, Minyong Cho, Taebum Kim, U Kang","Knowledge distillation is to transfer the knowledge of a large neural network into a smaller one and has been shown to be effective especially when the amount of training data is limited or the size of the student model is very small.

Global Guarantees for Blind Demodulation with Generative Priors,"Paul Hand, Babhru Joshi","We study a deep learning inspired formulation for the blind demodulation problem, which is the task of recovering two unknown vectors from their entrywise multiplication.

In the case when the networks corresponding to the generative models are expansive, the weight matrices are random and the dimension of the unknown vectors satisfy $\ell = \Omega(n^2+p^2)$, up to log factors, we show that the empirical risk objective has a favorable landscape for optimization. That is, the objective function has a descent direction at every point outside of a small neighborhood around four hyperbolic curves. We also characterize the local maximizers of the empirical risk objective and, hence, show that there does not exist any other stationary points outside of these neighborhood around four hyperbolic curves and the set of local maximizers. We also implement a gradient descent scheme inspired by the geometry of the landscape of the objective function. In order to converge to a global minimizer, this gradient descent scheme exploits the fact that exactly one of the hyperbolic curve corresponds to the global minimizer, and thus points near this hyperbolic curve have a lower objective value than points close to the other spurious hyperbolic curves.

DR and its variants ensure semiparametric local efficiency if Q-functions are well-specified, but if they are not they can be worse than both IS and SNIS. It also does not enjoy SNIS's inherent stability and boundedness.

Multi-mapping Image-to-Image Translation via Learning Disentanglement,"Xiaoming Yu, Yuanqi Chen, Shan Liu, Thomas Li, Ge Li","Recent advances of image-to-image translation focus on learning the one-to-many mapping from two aspects: multi-modal translation and multi-domain translation. However, the existing methods only consider one of the two perspectives, which makes them unable to solve each other's problem. To address this issue, we propose a novel unified model, which bridges these two objectives. First, we disentangle the input images into the latent representations by an encoder-decoder architecture with a conditional adversarial training in the feature space.

Explicitly disentangling image content from translation and rotation with spatial-VAE,"Tristan Bepler, Ellen Zhong, Kotaro Kelley, Edward Brignole, Bonnie Berger","Given an image dataset, we are often interested in finding data generative factors that encode semantic content independently from pose variables such as rotation and translation. However, current disentanglement approaches do not impose any specific structure on the learned latent representations.  We propose a method for explicitly disentangling image rotation and translation from other unstructured latent factors in a variational autoencoder (VAE) framework. By formulating the generative model as a function of the spatial coordinate, we make the reconstruction error differentiable with respect to latent translation and rotation parameters. This formulation allows us to train a neural network to perform approximate inference on these latent variables while explicitly constraining them to only represent rotation and translation. We demonstrate that this framework, termed spatial-VAE, effectively learns latent representations that disentangle image rotation and translation from content and improves reconstruction over standard VAEs on several benchmark datasets, including applications to modeling continuous 2-D views of proteins from single particle electron microscopy and galaxies in astronomical images.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/5a38a1eb24d99699159da10e71c45577-Paper.pdf,2019,"latent, rotation, translation, image, content, explicitly, factors, framework, generative, reconstruction","spatial, vae, latent, image, rotation, images, variables, translation, models, model","{'explicitly': 0.39581559869630684, 'rotation': 0.39581559869630684, 'content': 0.37461539436125013, 'disentangling': 0.37461539436125013, 'vae': 0.34790629563275277, 'translation': 0.33837340567151253, 'spatial': 0.3303134620527537, 'image': 0.24767781663398952}","{'rotation': 0.4734063010599996, 'translation': 0.37441011644621064, 'latent': 0.29458170543145595, 'vae': 0.17557005177668936, 'content': 0.1677248968966997, 'reconstruction': 0.14787155854688142, 'image': 0.14589816485802456, 'spatial': 0.14279828765845057, 'explicitly': 0.13710684821029187, 'factors': 0.13583252873841686}"
Imitation-Projected Programmatic Reinforcement Learning,"Abhinav Verma, Hoang Le, Yisong Yue, Swarat Chaudhuri","We study the problem of programmatic reinforcement learning, in which policies are represented as short programs in a symbolic language. Programmatic policies can be more interpretable, generalizable, and amenable to formal verification than neural policies; however, designing rigorous learning approaches for such policies remains a challenge. Our approach to this challenge - a meta-algorithm called PROPEL - is based on three insights. First, we view our learning task as optimization in policy space, modulo the constraint that the desired policy has a programmatic representation, and solve this optimization problem using a form of mirror descent that takes a gradient step into the unconstrained policy space and then projects back onto the constrained space.  Second, we view the unconstrained policy space as mixing neural and programmatic representations, which enables employing state-of-the-art deep policy gradient approaches.  Third, we cast the projection step as program synthesis via imitation learning, and exploit contemporary combinatorial methods for this task. We present theoretical convergence results for PROPEL and empirically evaluate the approach in three continuous control domains.

The Convergence Rate of Neural Networks for Learned Functions of Different Frequencies,"Basri Ronen, David Jacobs, Yoni Kasten, Shira Kritchman","We study the relationship between the frequency of a function and the speed at which a neural network learns it.  We build on recent results that show that the dynamics of overparameterized neural networks trained with gradient descent can be well approximated by a linear system.  When normalized training data is uniformly distributed on a hypersphere, the eigenfunctions of this linear system are spherical harmonic functions.  We derive the corresponding eigenvalues for each frequency after introducing a bias term in the model.  This bias term had been omitted from the linear network model without significantly affecting previous theoretical results.  However, we show theoretically and experimentally that a shallow neural network without bias cannot represent or learn simple, low frequency functions with odd frequencies.

A Game Theoretic Approach to Class-wise Selective Rationalization,"Shiyu Chang, Yang Zhang, Mo Yu, Tommi Jaakkola","Selection of input features such as relevant pieces of text has become a common technique of highlighting how complex neural predictors operate. The selection can be optimized post-hoc for trained models or incorporated directly into the method itself (self-explaining). However, an overall selection does not properly capture the multi-faceted nature of useful rationales such as pros and cons for decisions. To this end, we propose a new game theoretic approach to class-dependent rationalization, where the method is specifically trained to highlight evidence supporting alternative conclusions. Each class involves three players set up competitively to find evidence for factual and counterfactual scenarios. We show theoretically in a simplified scenario how the game drives the solution towards meaningful class-dependent rationales. We evaluate the method in single- and multi-aspect sentiment classification tasks and demonstrate that the proposed method is able to identify both factual (justifying the ground truth label) and counterfactual (countering the ground truth label) rationales consistent with human rationalization.

Search on the Replay Buffer: Bridging Planning and Reinforcement Learning,"Ben Eysenbach, Russ R.

Planning algorithms effectively reason over long horizons, but assume access to a local policy and distance metric over collision-free paths. Reinforcement learning excels at learning policies and relative values of states, but fails to plan over long horizons. Despite the successes of each method on various tasks, long horizon, sparse reward tasks with high-dimensional observations remain exceedingly challenging for both planning and reinforcement learning algorithms. Frustratingly, these sorts of tasks are potentially the most useful, as they are simple to design (a human only need to provide an example goal state) and avoid injecting bias through reward shaping. We introduce a general-purpose control algorithm that combines the strengths of planning and reinforcement learning to effectively solve these tasks. Our main idea is to decompose the task of reaching a distant goal state into a sequence of easier tasks, each of which corresponds to reaching a particular subgoal. We use goal-conditioned RL to learn a policy to reach each waypoint and to learn a distance metric for search. Using graph search over our replay buffer, we can automatically generate this sequence of subgoals, even in image-based environments. Our algorithm, search on the replay buffer (SoRB), enables agents to solve sparse reward tasks over hundreds of steps, and generalizes substantially better than standard RL algorithms.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/5c48ff18e0a47baaf81d8b8ea51eec92-Paper.pdf,2019,"learning, tasks, algorithms, planning, reinforcement, goal, long, reward, search, algorithm","goal, al, et, policy, rl, conditioned, distance, state, sorb, sg","{'buffer': 0.4967338186314423, 'bridging': 0.470128352627058, 'replay': 0.42464600808089586, 'planning': 0.38487310236485545, 'search': 0.3259527315259652, 'reinforcement': 0.27035545824812346, 'learning': 0.15635233092990508}","{'planning': 0.28708200788224697, 'tasks': 0.21874267936678168, 'buffer': 0.19411661946328923, 'reaching': 0.19411661946328923, 'reinforcement': 0.19084288030298344, 'horizons': 0.18781799364250296, 'reward': 0.18776550949831144, 'long': 0.1765155889169588, 'search': 0.16433507740956638, 'goal': 0.1627763670616032}"

In this paper,  we formulate the problem of randomization in SGB in terms of optimization of sampling probabilities to maximize  the  estimation  accuracy  of  split  scoring  used  to  train  decision  trees.This optimization problem has a closed-form nearly optimal solution, and it leads to a new sampling technique, which we call Minimal Variance Sampling (MVS).The method both decreases the number of examples needed for each iteration of boosting and increases the quality of the model significantly as compared to the state-of-the art sampling methods. The superiority of the algorithm was confirmed by introducing MVS as a new default option for subsampling in CatBoost, a gradient boosting library achieving state-of-the-art quality on various machine learning tasks.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/5c8cb735a1ce65dac514233cbd5576d6-Paper.pdf,2019,"sampling, boosting, approach, art, decision, gradient, iteration, learning, model, mvs","sampling, mvs, algorithm, gradient, learning, sample, gbdt, sgb, goss, boosting","{'minimal': 0.5237116007308403, 'boosting': 0.48637233208431324, 'variance': 0.38878920164809533, 'sampling': 0.36310345001776484, 'stochastic': 0.32258559713172424, 'gradient': 0.3195394930724675}","{'boosting': 0.40048535393198115, 'sampling': 0.3639820710397512, 'mvs': 0.262333443703492, 'sgb': 0.262333443703492, 'probabilities': 0.18817262511007077, 'trees': 0.18431826570331697, 'iteration': 0.16415263769432326, 'quality': 0.14013265027857572, 'decision': 0.1319946325810333, 'catboost': 0.131166721851746}"
Transductive Zero-Shot Learning with Visual Structure Constraint,"Ziyu Wan, Dongdong Chen, Yan Li, Xingguang Yan, Junge Zhang, Yizhou Yu, Jing Liao","To recognize objects of the unseen classes, most existing Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) methods first learn a compatible projection function between the common semantic space and the visual space based on the data of source seen classes, then directly apply it to the target unseen classes. However, in real scenarios, the data distribution between the source and target domain might not match well, thus causing the well-known domain shift problem. Based on the observation that visual features of test instances can be separated into different clusters, we propose a new visual structure constraint on class centers for transductive ZSL, to improve the generality of the projection function (\ie alleviate the above domain shift problem). Specifically, three different strategies (symmetric Chamfer-distance,Bipartite matching distance, and Wasserstein distance) are adopted to align the projected unseen semantic centers and visual cluster centers of test instances. We also propose a new training strategy to handle the real cases where many unrelated images exist in the test dataset, which is not considered in previous methods. Experiments on many widely used datasets demonstrate that the proposed visual structure constraint can bring substantial performance gain consistently and achieve state-of-the-art results.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/5ca359ab1e9e3b9c478459944a2d9ca5-Paper.pdf,2019,"visual, centers, classes, distance, domain, test, unseen, based, constraint, data","visual, centers, space, classes, structure, unseen, constraint, domain, semantic, real","{'transductive': 0.48324818107126205, 'constraint': 0.46384450722635834, 'zero': 0.3746942901028621, 'shot': 0.36625224579129084, 'visual': 0.3623970065329311, 'structure': 0.3458639073821999, 'learning': 0.1607156409646841}","{'visual': 0.3206763666113343, 'centers': 0.3033704423961518, 'zsl': 0.2365803601802891, 'unseen': 0.22069797818993242, 'classes': 0.19783571538853448, 'domain': 0.18497082705646922, 'distance': 0.18434992514136314, 'test': 0.16919788031565056, 'projection': 0.16309610667723676, 'shift': 0.1576472832871674}"

Residual Flows for Invertible Generative Modeling,"Ricky T. Q. Chen, Jens Behrmann, David K.

Invertible residual networks provide a flexible family of transformations where only Lipschitz conditions rather than strict architectural constraints are needed for enforcing invertibility.

We give a tractable unbiased estimate of the log density, and reduce the memory required during training by a factor of ten. Furthermore, we improve invertible residual blocks by proposing the use of activation functions that avoid gradient saturation and generalizing the Lipschitz condition to induced mixed norms.

Copula Multi-label Learning,Weiwei Liu,"A formidable challenge in multi-label learning is to model the interdependencies between labels and features. Unfortunately, the statistical properties of existing multi-label dependency modelings are still not well understood. Copulas are a powerful tool for modeling dependence of multivariate data, and achieve great success in a wide range of applications, such as finance, econometrics and systems neuroscience. This inspires us to develop a novel copula multi-label learning paradigm for modeling label and feature dependencies. The copula based paradigm enables to reveal new statistical insights in multi-label learning. In particular, the paper first leverages the kernel trick to construct continuous distribution in the output space, and then estimates our proposed model semiparametrically where the copula is modeled parametrically, while the marginal distributions are modeled nonparametrically. Theoretically, we show that our estimator is an unbiased and consistent estimator and follows asymptotically a normal distribution. Moreover, we bound the mean squared error of estimator.

Adversarial Training and Robustness for Multiple Perturbations,"Florian Tramer, Dan Boneh","Defenses against adversarial examples, such as adversarial training, are typically tailored to a single perturbation type (e.g., small $\ell_\infty$-noise). For other perturbations, these defenses offer no guarantees and, at times, even increase the model's vulnerability.
Our aim is to understand the reasons underlying this robustness trade-off, and to train models that are simultaneously robust to multiple perturbation types.

We prove that a trade-off in robustness to different types of $\ell_p$-bounded and spatial perturbations must exist in a natural and simple statistical setting.
We corroborate our formal analysis by demonstrating similar robustness trade-offs on MNIST and CIFAR10. We propose new multi-perturbation adversarial training schemes, as well as an efficient attack for the $\ell_1$-norm, and use these to show that models trained against multiple attacks fail to achieve robustness competitive with that of models trained on each attack individually. 
In particular, we find that adversarial training with first-order $\ell_\infty, \ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ attacks on MNIST achieves merely $50\%$ robust accuracy, partly because of gradient-masking.
Finally, we propose affine attacks that linearly interpolate between perturbation types and further degrade the accuracy of adversarially trained models.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/5d4ae76f053f8f2516ad12961ef7fe97-Paper.pdf,2019,"adversarial, models, perturbation, robustness, attacks, trade, trained, training, types, accuracy","attacks, perturbation, robustness, adv, perturbations, models, ℓ1, adversarial, training, attack","{'perturbations': 0.5299806214777281, 'multiple': 0.5187784129171473, 'robustness': 0.4198987500118354, 'training': 0.3837595322926562, 'adversarial': 0.35553222113089356}","{'perturbation': 0.3319132376889244, 'robustness': 0.2514344775458161, 'attacks': 0.22309699282517584, 'trade': 0.22034313743531614, 'types': 0.20963288518709386, 'adversarial': 0.2077296457333234, 'defenses': 0.20192178660008894, 'ell_': 0.18598333268101253, 'ell_1': 0.18300952549876748, 'infty': 0.1777972109504724}"

Differentially Private Bagging: Improved utility and cheaper privacy than subsample-and-aggregate,"James Jordon, Jinsung Yoon, Mihaela van der Schaar","Differential Privacy is a popular and well-studied notion of privacy.

A popular method forensuring differential privacy of a classifier is known as subsample-and-aggregate,in which the dataset is divided into distinct chunks and a model is learned on eachchunk, after which it is aggregated. This approach allows for easy analysis of themodel on the data and thus differential privacy can be easily applied. In this paper,we extend this approach by dividing the data several times (rather than just once)and learning models on each chunk within each division. The first benefit of thisapproach is the natural improvement of utility by aggregating models trained ona more diverse range of subsets of the data (as demonstrated by the well-knownbagging technique). The second benefit is that, through analysis that we provide inthe paper, we can derive tighter differential privacy guarantees when several queriesare made to this mechanism.

  We ground the semantics of a discrete latent variable by the target BOW. 
  We use this latent variable to build a fully differentiable content planning and surface realization pipeline. 
  Specifically, we use source words to predict their neighbors and model the target BOW with a mixture of softmax. 
  We use gumbel top-k reparameterization to perform differentiable subset sampling from the predicted BOW distribution.
  We retrieve the sampled word embeddings and use them to augment the decoder and guide its generation search space. 
  Our latent BOW model not only enhances the decoder, but also exhibits clear interpretability.
  We show the model interpretability with regard to (1). unsupervised learning of word neighbors (2). the step-by-step generation procedure. 
  Extensive experiments demonstrate the model's transparent and effective generation process.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/5e2b66750529d8ae895ad2591118466f-Paper.pdf,2019,"generation, latent, bow, model, use, discrete, decoder, differentiable, interpretability, neighbors","model, bow, words, target, latent, word, generation, models, neighbors, sentences","{'bag': 0.5080926233907402, 'paraphrase': 0.5080926233907402, 'words': 0.4808787705954052, 'generation': 0.35699127735265274, 'latent': 0.353548593543524}","{'bow': 0.4976053987264357, 'generation': 0.33460690802226484, 'latent': 0.31459291175016213, 'paraphrase': 0.1990421594905743, 'discrete': 0.17735299561335563, 'neighbors': 0.16052968081714308, 'use': 0.15697588521874836, 'words': 0.1463384949529538, 'word': 0.14127344148042748, 'decoder': 0.14013937050858988}"
Combinatorial Bandits with Relative Feedback,"Aadirupa Saha, Aditya Gopalan","We consider combinatorial online learning with subset choices when only relative feedback information from subsets is available, instead of bandit or semi-bandit feedback which is absolute. Specifically, we study two regret minimisation problems over subsets of a finite ground set $[n]$, with subset-wise relative preference information feedback according to the Multinomial logit choice model. In the first setting, the learner can play subsets of size bounded by a maximum size and receives top-$m$ rank-ordered feedback, while in the second setting the learner can play subsets of a fixed size $k$ with a full subset ranking observed as feedback. For both settings, we devise instance-dependent and order-optimal regret algorithms with regret $O(\frac{n}{m} \ln T)$ and $O(\frac{n}{k} \ln T)$, respectively. We derive fundamental limits on the regret performance of online learning with subset-wise preferences, proving the tightness of our regret guarantees.

Wide Feedforward or Recurrent Neural Networks of Any Architecture are Gaussian Processes,Greg Yang,"Wide neural networks with random weights and biases are Gaussian processes, as observed by Neal (1995) for shallow networks, and more recently by Lee et al.~(2018) and Matthews et al.~(2018) for deep fully-connected networks, as well as by Novak et al.~(2019) and Garriga-Alonso et al.~(2019) for deep convolutional networks.
We show that this Neural Network-Gaussian Process correspondence surprisingly extends to all modern feedforward or recurrent neural networks composed of multilayer perceptron, RNNs (e.g. LSTMs, GRUs), (nD or graph) convolution, pooling, skip connection, attention, batch normalization, and/or layer normalization.

An Accelerated Decentralized Stochastic Proximal Algorithm for Finite Sums,"Hadrien Hendrikx, Francis Bach, Laurent Massoulié","Modern large-scale finite-sum optimization relies on two key aspects: distribution and stochastic updates. For smooth and strongly convex problems, existing decentralized algorithms are slower than modern accelerated variance-reduced stochastic algorithms when run on a single machine, and are therefore not efficient. Centralized algorithms are fast, but their scaling is limited by global aggregation steps that result in communication bottlenecks. In this work, we propose an efficient \textbf{A}ccelerated \textbf{D}ecentralized stochastic algorithm for \textbf{F}inite \textbf{S}ums named ADFS, which uses local stochastic proximal updates and randomized pairwise communications between nodes. On $n$ machines, ADFS learns from $nm$ samples in the same time it takes optimal algorithms to learn from $m$ samples on one machine. This scaling holds until a critical network size is reached, which depends on communication delays, on the number of samples $m$, and on the network topology. We provide a theoretical analysis based on a novel augmented graph approach combined with a precise evaluation of synchronization times and an extension of the accelerated proximal coordinate gradient algorithm to arbitrary sampling.

We propose an adaptive framework that determines the next intervention based on a Bayesian prior updated with the outcomes of previous experiments, focusing on the setting where observational data is cheap (assumed infinite) and interventional data is expensive.
While information greedy approaches are popular in active learning, we show that in this setting they can be exponentially suboptimal (in the number of interventions required), and instead propose an algorithm that exploits graph structure in the form of a centrality measure.
If infinite interventional data is available, we show that the algorithm requires a number of interventions less than or equal to a factor of 2 times the minimum achievable number. We show that the algorithm and the associated theory can be adapted to the setting where each performed intervention yields finitely many samples. Several extensions are also presented, to the case where a specified set of nodes cannot be intervened on, to the case where $K$ interventions are scheduled at once, and to the fully adaptive case where each experiment yields only one sample.

Data Cleansing for Models Trained with SGD,"Satoshi Hara, Atsushi Nitanda, Takanori Maehara","Data cleansing is a typical approach used to improve the accuracy of machine learning models, which, however, requires extensive domain knowledge to identify the influential instances that affect the models. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that can identify influential instances without using any domain knowledge. The proposed algorithm automatically cleans the data, which does not require any of the users' knowledge. Hence, even non-experts can improve the models. The existing methods require the loss function to be convex and an optimal model to be obtained, which is not always the case in modern machine learning. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach specifically designed for the models trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The proposed method infers the influential instances by retracing the steps of the SGD while incorporating intermediate models computed in each step. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately infer the influential instances.

Universality and individuality in neural dynamics across large populations of recurrent networks,"Niru Maheswaranathan, Alex Williams, Matthew Golub, Surya Ganguli, David Sussillo","Many recent studies have employed task-based modeling with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to infer the computational function of different brain regions. These models are often assessed by quantitatively comparing the low-dimensional neural dynamics of the model and the brain, for example using canonical correlation analysis (CCA). However, the nature of the detailed neurobiological inferences one can draw from such efforts remains elusive. For example, to what extent does training neural networks to solve simple tasks, prevalent in neuroscientific studies, uniquely determine the low-dimensional dynamics independent of neural architectures?  Or alternatively, are the learned dynamics highly sensitive to different neural architectures?  Knowing the answer to these questions has strong implications on whether and how to use task-based RNN modeling to understand brain dynamics. To address these foundational questions, we study populations of thousands of networks of commonly used RNN architectures trained to solve neuroscientifically motivated tasks and characterize their low-dimensional dynamics via CCA and nonlinear dynamical systems analysis. We find the geometry of the dynamics can be highly sensitive to different network architectures, and further find striking dissociations between geometric similarity as measured by CCA and network function, yielding a cautionary tale. Moreover, we find that while the geometry of neural dynamics can vary greatly across architectures, the underlying computational scaffold: the topological structure of fixed points, transitions between them, limit cycles, and linearized dynamics, often appears {\it universal} across all architectures.  Overall, this analysis of universality and individuality across large populations of RNNs provides a much needed foundation for interpreting quantitative measures of dynamical similarity between RNN and brain dynamics.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/5f5d472067f77b5c88f69f1bcfda1e08-Paper.pdf,2019,"dynamics, architectures, neural, brain, across, analysis, cca, different, dimensional, find","ﬁxed, network, input, networks, trained, fig, rnn, dynamics, points, across","{'individuality': 0.4319099623024127, 'populations': 0.4087765145926288, 'universality': 0.4087765145926288, 'across': 0.3692296245248649, 'large': 0.30981040873117943, 'dynamics': 0.30346452998019335, 'recurrent': 0.2951002003832168, 'networks': 0.18407804389940874, 'neural': 0.18407804389940874}","{'dynamics': 0.3975001882265789, 'architectures': 0.27507626220061393, 'cca': 0.25224404518355054, 'brain': 0.22100156602256704, 'rnn': 0.1955814985856868, 'neural': 0.1615708543369115, 'populations': 0.16141052627048047, 'questions': 0.13374637796253383, 'rnns': 0.12249034387449097, 'dimensional': 0.12009963670351465}"

When to Trust Your Model: Model-Based Policy Optimization,"Michael Janner, Justin Fu, Marvin Zhang, Sergey Levine","Designing effective model-based reinforcement learning algorithms is difficult because the ease of data generation must be weighed against the bias of model-generated data. In this paper, we study the role of model usage in policy optimization both theoretically and empirically. We first formulate and analyze a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm with a guarantee of monotonic improvement at each step. In practice, this analysis is overly pessimistic and suggests that real off-policy data is always preferable to model-generated on-policy data, but we show that an empirical estimate of model generalization can be incorporated into such analysis to justify model usage. Motivated by this analysis, we then demonstrate that a simple procedure of using short model-generated rollouts branched from real data has the benefits of more complicated model-based algorithms without the usual pitfalls.

On Making Stochastic Classifiers Deterministic,"Andrew Cotter, Maya Gupta, Harikrishna Narasimhan","Stochastic classifiers arise in a number of machine learning problems, and have become especially prominent of late, as they often result from constrained optimization problems, e.g. for fairness, churn, or custom losses.

In this paper, we attempt to answer the theoretical question of how well a stochastic classifier can be approximated by a deterministic one, and compare several different approaches, proving lower and upper bounds.

Blind Super-Resolution Kernel Estimation using an Internal-GAN,"Sefi Bell-Kligler, Assaf Shocher, Michal Irani","Super resolution (SR) methods typically assume that the low-resolution (LR) image was downscaled from the unknown high-resolution (HR) image by a fixed `ideal’ downscaling kernel (e.g. Bicubic downscaling). However, this is rarely the case in real LR images, in contrast to synthetically generated SR datasets. When the assumed downscaling kernel deviates from the true one, the performance of SR methods significantly deteriorates. This gave rise to Blind-SR -  namely, SR when the downscaling kernel  (SR-kernel’’) is unknown.  It was further shown that the true SR-kernel is the one that maximizes the recurrence of patches across scales of the LR image. In this paper we show how this powerful cross-scale recurrence property can be realized using Deep Internal Learning. We introduceKernelGAN’’, an image-specific Internal-GAN,  which trains solely on the LR test image at test time, and learns its internal distribution of patches.

Learning to Learn By Self-Critique,"Antreas Antoniou, Amos J. Storkey","In few-shot learning, a machine learning system is required to learn from a small set of labelled examples of a specific task, such that it can achieve strong generalization on new unlabelled examples of the same task. Given the limited availability of labelled examples in such tasks, we need to make use of all the information we can. For this reason we propose the use of transductive meta-learning for few shot settings to obtain state-of-the-art few-shot learning.Usually a model learns task-specific information from a small training-set (the \emph{support-set}) and subsequently produces predictions on a small unlabelled validation set (\emph{target-set}). The target-set contains additional task-specific information which is not utilized by existing few-shot learning methods. This is a challenge requiring approaches beyond the current methods as at inference time, the target-set contains only input data-points, and so discriminative-based learning cannot be used.In this paper, we propose a framework called \emph{Self-Critique and Adapt} or SCA. This approach learns to learn a label-free loss function, parameterized as a neural network, which leverages target-set information. A base-model learns on a support-set using existing methods (e.g. stochastic gradient descent combined with the cross-entropy loss), and then is updated for the incoming target-task using a new learned loss function (i.e. the meta-learned label-free loss). This unsupervised loss function is optimized such that the learnt model achieves higher generalization performance. Experiments demonstrate that SCA offers substantially higher and state-of-the-art generalization performance compared to baselines which only adapt on the support-set.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/6018df1842f7130f1b85a6f8e911b96b-Paper.pdf,2019,"set, learning, loss, target, task, information, shot, emph, examples, function","set, model, learning, al, et, critic, loss, target, network, maml","{'critique': 0.6682246280272527, 'learn': 0.5576424755355525, 'self': 0.44527701772791184, 'learning': 0.21033091417991176}","{'set': 0.3778772464673782, 'target': 0.24728535541258873, 'shot': 0.24035022078417698, 'loss': 0.21421791029848067, 'sca': 0.1977811741182867, 'task': 0.19333654351341373, 'support': 0.17643626153967326, 'labelled': 0.16907845391778775, 'emph': 0.1689885453400873, 'unlabelled': 0.16505106056215493}"
Learning New Tricks From Old Dogs: Multi-Source Transfer Learning From Pre-Trained Networks,"Joshua Lee, Prasanna Sattigeri, Gregory Wornell","The advent of deep learning algorithms for mobile devices and sensors has led to a dramatic expansion in the availability and number of systems trained on a wide range of machine learning tasks, creating a host of opportunities and challenges in the realm of transfer learning.  Currently, most transfer learning methods require some kind of control over the systems learned, either by enforcing constraints during the source training, or through the use of a joint optimization objective between tasks that requires all data be co-located for training.  However, for practical, privacy, or other reasons, in a variety of applications we may have no control over the individual source task training, nor access to source training samples.  Instead we only have access to features pre-trained on such data as the output of ""black-boxes.''  For such scenarios, we consider the multi-source learning problem of training a classifier using an ensemble of pre-trained neural networks for a set of classes that have not been observed by any of the source networks, and for which we have very few training samples.  We show that by using these distributed networks as feature extractors, we can train an effective classifier in a computationally-efficient manner using tools from (nonlinear) maximal correlation analysis.  In particular, we develop a method we refer to as maximal correlation weighting (MCW) to build the required target classifier from an appropriate weighting of the feature functions from the source networks.  We illustrate the effectiveness of the resulting classifier on datasets derived from the CIFAR-100, Stanford Dogs, and Tiny ImageNet datasets, and, in addition, use the methodology to characterize the relative value of different source tasks in learning a target task.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/6048ff4e8cb07aa60b6777b6f7384d52-Paper.pdf,2019,"source, learning, training, classifier, networks, tasks, trained, using, access, control","source, target, task, training, learning, samples, data, correlation, dataset, maximal","{'dogs': 0.3680886526000237, 'old': 0.3680886526000237, 'tricks': 0.3680886526000237, 'pre': 0.34837352597480054, 'source': 0.31467029439855776, 'trained': 0.31467029439855776, 'new': 0.2898321723146508, 'transfer': 0.2612519361970918, 'learning': 0.23171975276989476, 'multi': 0.20874245464582533}","{'source': 0.4369262056001744, 'classifier': 0.2572627571354662, 'training': 0.20583744924010797, 'maximal': 0.19546376122858222, 'weighting': 0.15789592010548031, 'correlation': 0.14226212998278728, 'learning': 0.1417239584141031, 'trained': 0.13565825707206838, 'networks': 0.13251132601469112, 'pre': 0.13073772562488967}"
Globally Convergent Newton Methods for Ill-conditioned Generalized Self-concordant Losses,"Ulysse Marteau-Ferey, Francis Bach, Alessandro Rudi","In this paper, we study large-scale convex optimization algorithms based on the Newton method applied to regularized generalized self-concordant losses, which include logistic regression and softmax regression.  We first prove that our new simple scheme based on a sequence of problems with decreasing regularization parameters is provably globally convergent, that this convergence is linear with a constant factor which scales only logarithmically with the condition number. In the parametric setting, we obtain an algorithm with the same scaling than regular first-order methods but with an improved behavior, in particular in ill-conditioned problems. Second, in the non parametric machine learning setting, we provide an explicit algorithm combining  the previous scheme with Nystr\""om projections techniques, and prove that it achieves optimal generalization bounds with a time complexity of order O(n df), a memory complexity of order O(df^2) and no dependence on the condition number, generalizing the results known for least squares regression.

Is Deeper Better only when Shallow is Good?,"Eran Malach, Shai Shalev-Shwartz","Understanding the power of depth in feed-forward neural networks is an ongoing challenge in the field of deep learning theory. While current works account for the importance of depth for the expressive power of neural-networks, it remains an open question whether these benefits are exploited during a gradient-based optimization process.
In this work we explore the relation between expressivity properties of deep networks and the ability to train them efficiently using gradient-based algorithms. We give a depth separation argument for distributions with fractal structure, showing that they can be expressed efficiently by deep networks, but not with shallow ones.
These distributions have a natural coarse-to-fine structure, and we show that the balance between the coarse and fine details has a crucial effect on whether the optimization process is likely to succeed. We prove that when the distribution is concentrated on the fine details, gradient-based algorithms are likely to fail.
Using this result we prove that, at least in some distributions, the success of learning deep networks depends on whether the distribution can be approximated by shallower networks, and we conjecture that this property holds in general.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/606555cf42a6719782a952aa33cfa2cb-Paper.pdf,2019,"networks, deep, based, depth, distributions, fine, gradient, whether, algorithms, coarse","depth, networks, distribution, fractal, distributions, network, approximation, curve, deep, width","{'deeper': 0.5369067012430802, 'good': 0.5369067012430802, 'shallow': 0.4719198084793013, 'better': 0.44805589236769017}","{'networks': 0.25268979820187704, 'depth': 0.25216095987386994, 'fine': 0.24659709930754414, 'whether': 0.22969862723486245, 'details': 0.2119379006369198, 'likely': 0.2087938864877476, 'coarse': 0.20322390316775973, 'distributions': 0.19069732954870044, 'deep': 0.18817155541073463, 'power': 0.16024022370792412}"
Variance Reduced Policy Evaluation with Smooth Function Approximation,"Hoi-To Wai, Mingyi Hong, Zhuoran Yang, Zhaoran Wang, Kexin Tang","Policy evaluation with smooth and nonlinear function approximation has shown great potential for reinforcement learning.

This paper focuses on an offline setting where a trajectory of $m$ state-action pairs are observed.

k-Means Clustering of Lines for Big Data,"Yair Marom, Dan Feldman","The input to the \emph{$k$-mean for lines} problem is a set $L$ of $n$ lines in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and the goal is to compute
a set of $k$ centers (points) in $\mathbb{R}^d$ that minimizes the sum of squared distances over every line in $L$ and its nearest center. This is a straightforward generalization of the $k$-mean problem where the input is a set of $n$ points instead of lines.

We suggest the first PTAS that computes a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation to this problem in time $O(n \log n)$ for any constant approximation error $\epsilon \in (0, 1)$, and constant integers $k, d \geq 1$. This is by proving that there is always a weighted subset (called coreset) of $dk^{O(k)}\log (n)/\epsilon^2$ lines in $L$ that approximates the sum of squared distances from $L$ to \emph{any} given set of $k$ points. 

Using traditional merge-and-reduce technique, this coreset implies results for a streaming set (possibly infinite) of lines to $M$ machines in one pass (e.g. cloud) using memory, update time and communication that is near-logarithmic in $n$, as well as deletion of any line but using linear space. These results generalized for other distance functions such as $k$-median (sum of distances) or ignoring farthest $m$ lines from the given centers to handle outliers.

Correlation in Extensive-Form Games: Saddle-Point Formulation and Benchmarks,"Gabriele Farina, Chun Kai Ling, Fei Fang, Tuomas Sandholm","While Nash equilibrium in extensive-form games is well understood, very little is known about the properties of extensive-form correlated equilibrium (EFCE), both from a behavioral and from a computational point of view. In this setting, the strategic behavior of players is complemented by an external device that privately recommends moves to agents as the game progresses; players are free to deviate at any time, but will then not receive future recommendations. Our contributions are threefold. First, we show that an EFCE
can be formulated as the solution to a bilinear saddle-point problem. To showcase how this novel formulation can inspire new algorithms to compute EFCEs, we propose a simple subgradient descent method which exploits this formulation and structural properties of EFCEs. Our method has better scalability than the prior approach based on linear programming. Second, we propose two benchmark games, which we hope will serve as the basis for future evaluation of EFCE solvers.

The Thermodynamic Variational Objective,"Vaden Masrani, Tuan Anh Le, Frank Wood","We introduce the thermodynamic variational objective (TVO) for learning in both continuous and discrete deep generative models. The TVO arises from a key connection between variational inference and thermodynamic integration that results in a tighter lower bound to the log marginal likelihood than the standard variational evidence lower bound (ELBO) while remaining as broadly applicable. We provide a computationally efficient gradient estimator for the TVO that applies to continuous, discrete, and non-reparameterizable distributions and show that the objective functions used in variational inference, variational autoencoders, wake sleep, and inference compilation are all special cases of the TVO.

Sampling Sketches for Concave Sublinear Functions of Frequencies,"Edith Cohen, Ofir Geri","We consider massive distributed datasets that consist of elements modeled as key-value pairs and the task of computing statistics or aggregates where the contribution of each key is weighted by a function of its frequency (sum of values of its elements). This fundamental problem has a wealth of applications in data analytics and machine learning, in particular, with concave sublinear functions of the frequencies that mitigate the disproportionate effect of keys with high frequency. The family of concave sublinear functions includes low frequency moments ($p \leq 1$), capping, logarithms, and their compositions. A common approach is to sample keys, ideally, proportionally to their contributions and estimate statistics from the sample. A simple but costly way to do this is by aggregating the data to produce a table of keys and their frequencies, apply our function to the frequency values, and then apply a weighted sampling scheme. Our main contribution is the design of composable sampling sketches that can be tailored to any concave sublinear function of the frequencies. Our sketch structure size is very close to the desired sample size and our samples provide statistical guarantees on the estimation quality that are very close to that of an ideal sample of the same size computed over aggregated data.

Solving Interpretable Kernel Dimensionality Reduction,"Chieh Wu, Jared Miller, Yale Chang, Mario Sznaier, Jennifer Dy","Kernel dimensionality reduction (KDR) algorithms find a low dimensional representation of the original data by optimizing kernel dependency measures that are capable of capturing nonlinear relationships. The standard strategy is to first map the data into a high dimensional feature space using kernels prior to a projection onto a low dimensional space. While KDR methods can be easily solved by keeping the most dominant eigenvectors of the kernel matrix, its features are no longer easy to interpret.  Alternatively, Interpretable KDR (IKDR) is different in that it projects onto a subspace \textit{before} the kernel feature mapping, therefore, the projection matrix can indicate how the original features linearly combine to form the new features. Unfortunately, the IKDR objective requires a non-convex manifold optimization that is difficult to solve and can no longer be solved by eigendecomposition. Recently, an efficient iterative spectral (eigendecomposition) method (ISM) has been proposed for this objective in the context of alternative clustering. However, ISM only provides theoretical guarantees for the Gaussian kernel. This greatly constrains ISM's usage since any kernel method using ISM is now limited to a single kernel. This work extends the theoretical guarantees of ISM to an entire family of kernels, thereby empowering ISM to solve any kernel method of the same objective. In identifying this family, we prove that each kernel within the family has a surrogate $\Phi$ matrix and the optimal projection is formed by its most dominant eigenvectors. With this extension, we establish how a wide range of IKDR applications across different learning paradigms can be solved by ISM.

Learning Imbalanced Datasets with Label-Distribution-Aware Margin Loss,"Kaidi Cao, Colin Wei, Adrien Gaidon, Nikos Arechiga, Tengyu Ma","Deep learning algorithms can fare poorly when the training dataset suffers from heavy class-imbalance but the testing criterion requires good generalization on less frequent classes. We design two novel methods to improve performance in such scenarios. First, we propose a theoretically-principled label-distribution-aware margin (LDAM) loss motivated by minimizing a margin-based generalization bound. This loss replaces the standard cross-entropy objective during training and can be applied with prior strategies for training with class-imbalance such as re-weighting or re-sampling. Second, we propose a simple, yet effective, training schedule that defers re-weighting until after the initial stage, allowing the model to learn an initial representation while avoiding some of the complications associated with re-weighting or re-sampling. We test our methods on several benchmark vision tasks including the real-world imbalanced dataset iNaturalist 2018.

An advantage of our method compared to traditional adaptive MCMC methods is that the adaptation occurs even when candidate state values are rejected. This is a highly desirable property of any adaptation strategy because the adaptation starts in early iterations even if the initial proposal distribution is far from optimum.

We also prove a lower bound that matches the upper bound in all parameters (up to a $\log(n)$ factor). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first **polynomial-time** algorithm that achieves the optimal $O(n^{1/3})$ rate in forecasting total variation bounded sequences and the first algorithm that **adapts to unknown** $C_n$.Our proof techniques leverage the special localized structure of Haar wavelet basis and the adaptivity to unknown smoothness parameters in the classical wavelet smoothing [Donoho et al., 1998]. We also compare our model to the rich literature of dynamic regret minimization and nonstationary stochastic optimization, where our problem can be treated as a special case. We show that the workhorse in those settings --- online gradient descent and its variants with a fixed restarting schedule --- are instances of a class of **linear forecasters** that require a suboptimal regret of $\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{n})$.

Unsupervised Scale-consistent Depth and Ego-motion Learning from Monocular Video,"Jiawang Bian, Zhichao Li, Naiyan Wang, Huangying Zhan, Chunhua Shen, Ming-Ming Cheng, Ian Reid","Recent work has shown that CNN-based depth and ego-motion estimators can be learned using unlabelled monocular videos. However, the performance is limited by unidentified moving objects that violate the underlying static scene assumption in geometric image reconstruction. More significantly, due to lack of proper constraints, networks output scale-inconsistent results over different samples, i.e., the ego-motion network cannot provide full camera trajectories over a long video sequence because of the per-frame scale ambiguity. This paper tackles these challenges by proposing a geometry consistency loss for scale-consistent predictions and an induced self-discovered mask for handling moving objects and occlusions. Since we do not leverage multi-task learning like recent works, our framework is much simpler and more efficient. Comprehensive evaluation results demonstrate that our depth estimator achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI dataset. Moreover, we show that our ego-motion network is able to predict a globally scale-consistent camera trajectory for long video sequences, and the resulting visual odometry accuracy is competitive with the recent model that is trained using stereo videos. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to show that deep networks trained using unlabelled monocular videos can predict globally scale-consistent camera trajectories over a long video sequence.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/6364d3f0f495b6ab9dcf8d3b5c6e0b01-Paper.pdf,2019,"scale, camera, consistent, ego, long, motion, recent, using, video, videos","depth, scale, network, loss, image, results, using, proposed, al, et","{'ego': 0.4168716533383715, 'monocular': 0.4168716533383715, 'depth': 0.3563737294149622, 'motion': 0.3563737294149622, 'video': 0.3340457457241343, 'consistent': 0.31379603069523704, 'scale': 0.30236183264062727, 'unsupervised': 0.2823775040698777, 'learning': 0.13121485240854514}","{'ego': 0.30131130376230597, 'camera': 0.25067837594153386, 'scale': 0.23133581524273972, 'videos': 0.22595908023064462, 'motion': 0.21751989887823214, 'monocular': 0.21224205925652773, 'video': 0.20046811375574655, 'moving': 0.1928085797868025, 'unlabelled': 0.1771188644842144, 'long': 0.17532615240987254}"
Variational Denoising Network: Toward Blind Noise Modeling and Removal,"Zongsheng Yue, Hongwei Yong, Qian Zhao, Deyu Meng, Lei Zhang","Blind image denoising is an important yet very challenging problem in computer
vision due to the complicated acquisition process of real images. In this work we
propose a new variational inference method, which integrates both noise estimation and image denoising into a unique Bayesian framework, for blind image denoising. Specifically, an approximate posterior, parameterized by deep neural networks, is presented by taking the intrinsic clean image and noise variances as latent variables conditioned on the input noisy image. This posterior provides explicit parametric forms for all its involved hyper-parameters, and thus can be easily implemented for blind image denoising with automatic noise estimation for the test noisy image. On one hand, as other data-driven deep learning methods, our method, namely variational denoising network (VDN), can perform denoising efficiently due to its explicit form of posterior expression. On the other hand, VDN inherits the advantages of traditional model-driven approaches, especially the good generalization capability of generative models. VDN has good interpretability and can be flexibly utilized to estimate and remove complicated non-i.i.d. noise collected in real scenarios. Comprehensive experiments are performed to substantiate the superiority of our method in blind image denoising.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/6395ebd0f4b478145ecfbaf939454fa4-Paper.pdf,2019,"image, denoising, blind, noise, method, posterior, vdn, complicated, deep, driven","image, noise, σ2, denoising, 28, noisy, methods, vdn, training, network","{'removal': 0.4505725824257297, 'toward': 0.3960355240716323, 'blind': 0.38518385763412055, 'denoising': 0.38518385763412055, 'noise': 0.3306467992800231, 'modeling': 0.29140890667512154, 'variational': 0.2819414743075012, 'network': 0.26394990353722547}","{'denoising': 0.5159551251374146, 'image': 0.32667207471508863, 'blind': 0.3074735215408902, 'vdn': 0.2976289370663945, 'noise': 0.19282441740185272, 'posterior': 0.17029720718405653, 'complicated': 0.14935816707381838, 'driven': 0.12494143468250146, 'hand': 0.11925203608855434, 'explicit': 0.11800367466412424}"
Multi-task Learning for Aggregated Data using Gaussian Processes,"Fariba Yousefi, Michael T. Smith, Mauricio Álvarez","Aggregated data is commonplace in areas such as epidemiology and demography. For example, census data for a population is usually given as averages defined over time periods or spatial resolutions (cities, regions or countries). In this paper, we present a novel multi-task learning model based on Gaussian processes for joint learning of variables that have been aggregated at different input scales. Our model represents each task as the linear combination of the realizations of latent processes that are integrated at a different scale per task. We are then able to compute the cross-covariance between the different tasks either analytically or numerically. We also allow each task to have a potentially different likelihood model and provide a variational lower bound that can be optimised in a stochastic fashion making our model suitable for larger datasets.

Keeping Your Distance: Solving Sparse Reward Tasks Using Self-Balancing Shaped Rewards,"Alexander Trott, Stephan Zheng, Caiming Xiong, Richard Socher","While using shaped rewards can be beneficial when solving sparse reward tasks, their successful application often requires careful engineering and is problem specific.  For instance, in tasks where the agent must achieve some goal state, simple distance-to-goal reward shaping often fails, as it renders learning vulnerable to local optima. We introduce a simple and effective model-free method to learn from shaped distance-to-goal rewards on tasks where success depends on reaching a goal state.  Our method introduces an auxiliary distance-based reward based on pairs of rollouts to encourage diverse exploration.  This approach effectively prevents learning dynamics from stabilizing around local optima induced by the naive distance-to-goal reward shaping and enables policies to efficiently solve sparse reward tasks.  Our augmented objective does not require any additional reward engineering or domain expertise to implement and converges to the original sparse objective as the agent learns to solve the task.  We demonstrate that our method successfully solves a variety of hard-exploration tasks (including maze navigation and 3D construction in a Minecraft environment), where naive distance-based reward shaping otherwise fails, and intrinsic curiosity and reward relabeling strategies exhibit poor performance.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/64c26b2a2dcf068c49894bd07e0e6389-Paper.pdf,2019,"reward, distance, goal, tasks, based, method, shaping, sparse, agent, engineering","goal, reward, al, et, agent, distance, learning, state, policy, task","{'keeping': 0.3659387248041906, 'shaped': 0.3659387248041906, 'balancing': 0.34633875005455644, 'rewards': 0.31283237190985347, 'tasks': 0.30538080734403833, 'reward': 0.29892596851478465, 'distance': 0.2932323971602193, 'solving': 0.2932323971602193, 'self': 0.2438463014046821, 'sparse': 0.2350329711377477}","{'reward': 0.473395828219887, 'distance': 0.2623739509584384, 'goal': 0.25649563285624666, 'shaping': 0.25289038420831794, 'shaped': 0.17757305686602232, 'tasks': 0.1723424075302652, 'optima': 0.16859358947221195, 'fails': 0.16503002417433624, 'engineering': 0.15653141839416515, 'sparse': 0.15294422405794536}"
Efficient characterization of electrically evoked responses for neural interfaces,"Nishal Shah, Sasidhar Madugula, Pawel Hottowy, Alexander Sher, Alan Litke, Liam Paninski, E.J. Chichilnisky","Future neural interfaces will read and write population neural activity with high spatial and temporal resolution, for diverse applications. For example, an artificial retina may restore vision to the blind by electrically stimulating retinal ganglion cells. Such devices must tune their function, based on stimulating and recording, to match the function of the circuit. However, existing methods for characterizing the neural interface scale poorly with the number of electrodes, limiting their practical applicability. This work tests the idea that using prior information from previous experiments and closed-loop measurements may greatly increase the efficiency of the neural interface. Large-scale, high-density electrical recording and stimulation in primate retina were used as a lab prototype for an artificial retina. Three key calibration steps were optimized: spike sorting in the presence of stimulation artifacts, response modeling, and adaptive stimulation. For spike sorting, exploiting the similarity of electrical artifact across electrodes and experiments substantially reduced the number of required measurements. For response modeling, a joint model that captures the inverse relationship between recorded spike amplitude and electrical stimulation threshold from previously recorded retinas resulted in greater consistency and efficiency. For adaptive stimulation, choosing which electrodes to stimulate based on probability estimates from previous measurements improved efficiency. Similar improvements resulted from using either non-adaptive stimulation with a joint model across cells, or adaptive stimulation with an independent model for each cell. Finally, image reconstruction revealed that these improvements may translate to improved performance of an artificial retina.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/65184321c340b4d56581ee59b58d9d56-Paper.pdf,2019,"stimulation, adaptive, neural, retina, artificial, efficiency, electrical, electrodes, may, measurements","stimulation, adaptive, spike, electrode, response, al, et, model, using, electrical","{'electrically': 0.4412768022066933, 'evoked': 0.4412768022066933, 'responses': 0.4412768022066933, 'characterization': 0.4008722579510003, 'interfaces': 0.4008722579510003, 'efficient': 0.24301612397858527, 'neural': 0.18807014808220512}","{'stimulation': 0.5095990676803965, 'retina': 0.27043770615062007, 'electrical': 0.23075925309582038, 'electrodes': 0.23075925309582038, 'spike': 0.18491098199130598, 'adaptive': 0.15930333399668273, 'artificial': 0.15766504080120783, 'measurements': 0.1550127030891007, 'stimulating': 0.15383950206388025, 'resulted': 0.13521885307531004}"
The Synthesis of XNOR Recurrent Neural Networks with Stochastic Logic,"Arash Ardakani, Zhengyun Ji, Amir Ardakani, Warren Gross","The emergence of XNOR networks seek to reduce the model size and computational cost of neural networks for their deployment on specialized hardware requiring real-time processes with limited hardware resources. In XNOR networks, both weights and activations are binary, bringing great benefits to specialized hardware by replacing expensive multiplications with simple XNOR operations. Although XNOR convolutional and fully-connected neural networks have been successfully developed during the past few years, there is no XNOR network implementing commonly-used variants of recurrent neural networks such as long short-term memories (LSTMs). The main computational core of LSTMs involves vector-matrix multiplications followed by a set of non-linear functions and element-wise multiplications to obtain the gate activations and state vectors, respectively. Several previous attempts on quantization of LSTMs only focused on quantization of the vector-matrix multiplications in LSTMs while retaining the element-wise multiplications in full precision. In this paper, we propose a method that converts all the multiplications in LSTMs to XNOR operations using stochastic computing. To this end, we introduce a weighted finite-state machine and its synthesis method to approximate the non-linear functions used in LSTMs on stochastic bit streams. Experimental results show that the proposed XNOR LSTMs reduce the computational complexity of their quantized counterparts by a factor of 86x without any sacrifice on latency while achieving a better accuracy across various temporal tasks.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/6562c5c1f33db6e05a082a88cddab5ea-Paper.pdf,2019,"lstms, xnor, multiplications, networks, computational, hardware, neural, activations, element, functions","stochastic, state, xnor, vector, computations, lstm, using, function, gate, binary","{'xnor': 0.5312794594768098, 'logic': 0.4669736849713313, 'synthesis': 0.41163932497069655, 'recurrent': 0.36299388445529707, 'stochastic': 0.3097194784204237, 'networks': 0.22642886758872993, 'neural': 0.22642886758872993}","{'xnor': 0.5439734071039423, 'lstms': 0.42147469115931596, 'multiplications': 0.40982671211745264, 'hardware': 0.1566062350000434, 'networks': 0.11964685605253672, 'element': 0.11863493782028116, 'specialized': 0.11272862999751251, 'computational': 0.11057311991138705, 'quantization': 0.10714564661120926, 'activations': 0.10527793438052198}"

Automated metrics are noisy indirect proxies, because they rely on heuristics or pretrained embeddings. However, up until now, direct human evaluation strategies have been ad-hoc, neither standardized nor validated. Our work establishes a gold standard human benchmark for generative realism. We construct Human eYe Perceptual Evaluation (HYPE) a human benchmark that is (1) grounded in psychophysics research in perception, (2) reliable across different sets of randomly sampled outputs from a model, (3) able to produce separable model performances, and (4) efficient in cost and time. We introduce two variants: one that measures visual perception under adaptive time constraints to determine the threshold at which a model's outputs appear real (e.g. $250$ms), and the other a less expensive variant that measures human error rate on fake and real images sans time constraints. We test HYPE across six state-of-the-art generative adversarial networks and two sampling techniques on conditional and unconditional image generation using four datasets: CelebA, FFHQ, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet.

To establish algorithm-dependent generalization theory for learning with non-i.i.d. data, we first prove novel McDiarmid-type concentration inequalities for Lipschitz functions of graph-dependent random variables. We show that concentration relies on the forest complexity of the graph, which characterizes the strength of the dependency.

Are sample means in multi-armed bandits positively or negatively biased?,"Jaehyeok Shin, Aaditya Ramdas, Alessandro Rinaldo","It is well known that in stochastic multi-armed bandits (MAB), the sample mean of an arm is typically not an unbiased estimator of its true mean. In this paper, we decouple three different sources of this selection bias: adaptive \emph{sampling} of arms, adaptive \emph{stopping} of the experiment, and adaptively \emph{choosing} which arm to study.  Through a new notion called ``optimism'' that captures certain natural monotonic behaviors of algorithms, we provide a clean and unified analysis of how optimistic rules affect the sign of the bias. The main takeaway message is that optimistic sampling induces a negative bias, but optimistic stopping and optimistic choosing both induce a positive bias. These results are derived in a general stochastic MAB setup that is entirely agnostic to the final aim of the experiment (regret minimization or best-arm identification or anything else). We provide examples of optimistic rules of each type, demonstrate that simulations confirm our theoretical predictions, and pose some natural but hard open problems.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/65b1e92c585fd4c2159d5f33b5030ff2-Paper.pdf,2019,"optimistic, bias, arm, emph, adaptive, choosing, experiment, mab, mean, natural","bias, sampling, stopping, arm, sample, optimistic, mean, time, ﬁxed, choosing","{'negatively': 0.42675072504376316, 'positively': 0.42675072504376316, 'biased': 0.40389361026390086, 'means': 0.36481911446001003, 'armed': 0.34860173343598155, 'sample': 0.2866701228522284, 'bandits': 0.2779802511179003, 'multi': 0.24200961708080393}","{'optimistic': 0.4581898918763188, 'arm': 0.2612271885783169, 'bias': 0.2593803967072447, 'mab': 0.21812096886359325, 'stopping': 0.21104345860023854, 'emph': 0.20515156292546563, 'choosing': 0.18905870369454755, 'experiment': 0.16552645666718785, 'rules': 0.1552889571605907, 'mean': 0.13276201303708846}"
The Landscape of Non-convex Empirical Risk with Degenerate Population Risk,"Shuang Li, Gongguo Tang, Michael B. Wakin","The landscape of empirical risk has been widely studied in a series of machine learning problems, including low-rank matrix factorization, matrix sensing, matrix completion, and phase retrieval. In this work, we focus on the situation where the corresponding population risk is a degenerate non-convex loss function, namely, the Hessian of the population risk can have zero eigenvalues. Instead of analyzing the non-convex empirical risk directly, we first study the landscape of the corresponding population risk, which is usually easier to characterize, and then build a connection between the landscape of the empirical risk and its population risk. In particular, we establish a correspondence between the critical points of the empirical risk and its population risk without the strongly Morse assumption, which is required in existing literature but not satisfied in degenerate scenarios. We also apply the theory to matrix sensing and phase retrieval to demonstrate how to infer the landscape of empirical risk from that of the corresponding population risk.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/65fc52ed8f88c81323a418ca94cec2ed-Paper.pdf,2019,"risk, population, empirical, landscape, matrix, corresponding, convex, degenerate, non, phase","risk, population, empirical, rn, matrix, latexit, points, critical, hessian, also","{'risk': 0.6232069522891531, 'degenerate': 0.3610270428386344, 'landscape': 0.3610270428386344, 'population': 0.3610270428386344, 'empirical': 0.3003593680015307, 'convex': 0.25838943341702436, 'non': 0.25221155482687146}","{'risk': 0.6397881262513914, 'population': 0.38072492498008814, 'landscape': 0.28346693872327655, 'empirical': 0.21536794253559366, 'matrix': 0.19531868774689412, 'degenerate': 0.16489329759933516, 'corresponding': 0.16069751119435627, 'sensing': 0.14680120716659883, 'retrieval': 0.14173346936163828, 'phase': 0.1338435247389197}"
Hybrid 8-bit Floating Point (HFP8) Training and Inference for Deep Neural Networks,"Xiao Sun, Jungwook Choi, Chia-Yu Chen, Naigang Wang, Swagath Venkataramani, Vijayalakshmi (Viji) Srinivasan, Xiaodong Cui, Wei Zhang, Kailash Gopalakrishnan","Reducing the numerical precision of data and computation is extremely effective in accelerating deep learning training workloads. Towards this end, 8-bit floating point representations (FP8) were recently proposed for DNN training. However, its applicability was demonstrated on a few selected models only and significant degradation is observed when popular networks such as MobileNet and Transformer are trained using FP8. This degradation is due to the inherent precision requirement difference in the forward and backward passes of DNN training. Using theoretical insights, we propose a hybrid FP8 (HFP8) format and DNN end-to-end distributed training procedure. We demonstrate, using HFP8, the successful training of deep learning models across a whole spectrum of applications including Image Classification, Object Detection, Language and Speech without accuracy degradation. Finally, we demonstrate that, by using the new 8 bit format, we can directly quantize a pre-trained model down to 8-bits without losing accuracy by simply fine-tuning batch normalization statistics.

Are deep ResNets provably better than linear predictors?,"Chulhee Yun, Suvrit Sra, Ali Jadbabaie","Recent results in the literature indicate that a residual network (ResNet) composed of a single residual block outperforms linear predictors, in the sense that all local minima in its optimization landscape are at least as good as the best linear predictor. However, these results are limited to a single residual block (i.e., shallow ResNets), instead of the deep ResNets composed of multiple residual blocks. We take a step towards extending this result to deep ResNets. We start by two motivating examples. First, we show that there exist datasets for which all local minima of a fully-connected ReLU network are no better than the best linear predictor, whereas a ResNet has strictly better local minima. Second, we show that even at the global minimum, the representation obtained from the residual block outputs of a 2-block ResNet do not necessarily improve monotonically over subsequent blocks, which highlights a fundamental difficulty in analyzing deep ResNets. Our main theorem on deep ResNets shows under simple geometric conditions that, any critical point in the optimization landscape is either (i) at least as good as the best linear predictor; or (ii) the Hessian at this critical point has a strictly negative eigenvalue. Notably, our theorem shows that a chain of multiple skip-connections can improve the optimization landscape, whereas existing results study direct skip-connections to the last hidden layer or output layer. Finally, we complement our results by showing benign properties of the ""near-identity regions"" of deep ResNets, showing depth-independent upper bounds for the risk attained at critical points as well as the Rademacher complexity.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/661c1c090ff5831a647202397c61d73c-Paper.pdf,2019,"resnets, deep, residual, block, linear, results, best, critical, landscape, local","resnets, linear, block, residual, err, risk, resnet, network, bound, critical","{'predictors': 0.5174041759036585, 'resnets': 0.47002919534987075, 'better': 0.431780771617387, 'provably': 0.40740287756107635, 'linear': 0.3161586925603689, 'deep': 0.2428938369147633}","{'resnets': 0.4386123952946839, 'residual': 0.2966839254794224, 'block': 0.2220615639411837, 'predictor': 0.21058193737687866, 'minima': 0.19284886997982925, 'landscape': 0.18850389128971035, 'resnet': 0.17955347698106977, 'deep': 0.15065219688168918, 'critical': 0.14774488213450496, 'skip': 0.14038795825125244}"
E2-Train: Training State-of-the-art CNNs with Over 80% Energy Savings,"Yue Wang, Ziyu Jiang, Xiaohan Chen, Pengfei Xu, Yang Zhao, Yingyan Lin, Zhangyang Wang","Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been increasingly deployed to edge devices. Hence, many efforts have been made towards efficient CNN inference on resource-constrained platforms. This paper attempts to explore an orthogonal direction: how to conduct more energy-efficient training of CNNs, so as to enable on-device training? We strive to reduce the energy cost during training, by dropping unnecessary computations, from three complementary levels: stochastic mini-batch dropping on the data level; selective layer update on the model level; and sign prediction for low-cost, low-precision back-propagation, on the algorithm level. Extensive simulations and ablation studies, with real energy measurements from an FPGA board, confirm the superiority of our proposed strategies and demonstrate remarkable energy savings for training. For example, when training ResNet-74 on CIFAR-10, we achieve aggressive energy savings of >90% and >60%, while incurring a top-1 accuracy loss of only about 2% and 1.2%, respectively.

Graph Neural Tangent Kernel: Fusing Graph Neural Networks with Graph Kernels,"Simon S. Du, Kangcheng Hou, Russ R. Salakhutdinov, Barnabas Poczos, Ruosong Wang, Keyulu Xu","While graph kernels (GKs) are easy to train and enjoy provable theoretical guarantees, their practical performances are limited by their expressive power, as the kernel function often depends on hand-crafted combinatorial features of graphs. Compared to graph kernels, graph neural networks (GNNs) usually achieve better practical performance, as GNNs use multi-layer architectures and non-linear activation functions to extract high-order information of graphs as features. However, due to the large number of hyper-parameters and the non-convex nature of the training procedure, GNNs are harder to train. Theoretical guarantees of GNNs are also not well-understood. Furthermore, the expressive power of GNNs scales with the number of parameters, and thus it is hard to exploit the full power of GNNs when computing resources are limited. The current paper presents a new class of graph kernels, Graph Neural Tangent Kernels (GNTKs), which correspond to \emph{infinitely wide} multi-layer GNNs trained by gradient descent. GNTKs enjoy the full expressive power of GNNs and inherit advantages of GKs. Theoretically, we show GNTKs provably learn a class of smooth functions on graphs.

Privacy-Preserving Q-Learning with Functional Noise in Continuous Spaces,"Baoxiang Wang, Nidhi Hegde","We consider differentially private algorithms for reinforcement learning in continuous spaces, such that neighboring reward functions are indistinguishable. This protects the reward information from being exploited by methods such as inverse reinforcement learning. Existing studies that guarantee differential privacy are not extendable to infinite state spaces, as the noise level to ensure privacy will scale accordingly to infinity. Our aim is to protect the value function approximator, without regard to the number of states queried to the function. It is achieved by adding functional noise to the value function iteratively in the training. We show rigorous privacy guarantees by a series of analyses on the kernel of the noise space, the probabilistic bound of such noise samples, and the composition over the iterations.

Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI), fueled by massive datasets, deeper models, and mighty computation, has come to a stage where (super-)human-level performances are observed in certain specific tasks.  However, current AI's ability in “thinking in pictures” is still far lacking behind.

Combining all the elements, we propose the Contrastive Perceptual Inference network (CoPINet) and empirically demonstrate that CoPINet sets the new state-of-the-art for permutation-invariant models on two major datasets.

Enhancing the Locality and Breaking the Memory Bottleneck of Transformer on Time Series Forecasting,"Shiyang Li, Xiaoyong Jin, Yao Xuan, Xiyou Zhou, Wenhu Chen, Yu-Xiang Wang, Xifeng Yan","Time series forecasting is an important problem across many domains, including predictions of solar plant energy output, electricity consumption, and traffic jam situation. In this paper, we propose to tackle such forecasting problem with Transformer. Although impressed by its performance in our preliminary study, we found its two major weaknesses: (1) locality-agnostics: the point-wise dot- product self-attention in canonical Transformer architecture is insensitive to local context, which can make the model prone to anomalies in time series; (2) memory bottleneck: space complexity of canonical Transformer grows quadratically with sequence length L, making directly modeling long time series infeasible.

Updates of Equilibrium Prop Match Gradients of Backprop Through Time in an RNN with Static Input,"Maxence Ernoult, Julie Grollier, Damien Querlioz, Yoshua Bengio, Benjamin Scellier","Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a biologically inspired learning algorithm for
convergent recurrent neural networks, i.e. RNNs that are fed by a static input x and
settle to a steady state. Training convergent RNNs consists in adjusting the weights
until the steady state of output neurons coincides with a target y. Convergent RNNs
can also be trained with the more conventional Backpropagation Through Time
(BPTT) algorithm. In its original formulation EP was described in the case of
real-time neuronal dynamics, which is computationally costly. In this work, we
introduce a discrete-time version of EP with simplified equations and with reduced
simulation time, bringing EP closer to practical machine learning tasks. We first
prove theoretically, as well as numerically that the neural and weight updates of EP,
computed by forward-time dynamics, are step-by-step equal to the ones obtained by
BPTT, with gradients computed backward in time. The equality is strict when the
transition function of the dynamics derives from a primitive function and the steady
state is maintained long enough. We then show for more standard discrete-time
neural network dynamics that the same property is approximately respected and
we subsequently demonstrate training with EP with equivalent performance to
BPTT. In particular, we define the first convolutional architecture trained with EP
achieving ∼ 1% test error on MNIST, which is the lowest error reported with EP.

Toward a Characterization of Loss Functions for Distribution Learning,"Nika Haghtalab, Cameron Musco, Bo Waggoner","In this work we study loss functions for learning and evaluating probability distributions over large discrete domains. Unlike  classification or regression where a wide variety of loss functions are used, in the distribution learning and density estimation literature, very few losses outside the dominant \emph{log loss} are applied. We aim to understand this fact, taking an axiomatic approach to the design of loss functions for distributions. We start by proposing a set of desirable criteria that any good loss function should satisfy. Intuitively, these criteria require that the loss function faithfully evaluates a candidate distribution, both in expectation and when estimated on a few samples. Interestingly, we observe that \emph{no loss function} possesses all of these criteria. However, one can circumvent this issue by introducing a natural restriction on the set of candidate distributions.  Specifically, we require that candidates are \emph{calibrated} with respect to the target distribution, i.e., they may contain less information than the target but otherwise do not significantly distort the truth. We show that, after restricting to this set of distributions, the log loss and a large variety of other losses satisfy the desired criteria. These results pave the way for future investigations of distribution learning that look beyond the log loss, choosing a loss function based on  application or domain need.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/679d8bbd776e0bbf3b044306c5be94ae-Paper.pdf,2019,"loss, criteria, distribution, distributions, function, emph, functions, learning, log, set","loss, distribution, function, ln, calibrated, log, proper, distributions, qx, properness","{'characterization': 0.49603515230644035, 'toward': 0.4799399831912278, 'distribution': 0.41101969305215824, 'loss': 0.40567434321984314, 'functions': 0.4006979415815857, 'learning': 0.17186924972044612}","{'loss': 0.4763530484040574, 'criteria': 0.3357075459333564, 'distributions': 0.20440742972486559, 'emph': 0.18788860512633054, 'distribution': 0.1697003129265483, 'log': 0.16447303363789778, 'candidate': 0.15773603096174238, 'function': 0.15701504166967212, 'losses': 0.1545051074713262, 'satisfy': 0.14324115054567366}"

Deliberative Explanations: visualizing network insecurities,"Pei Wang, Nuno Nvasconcelos","A new approach to explainable AI, denoted {\it deliberative explanations,\/}
  is proposed. Deliberative explanations are a visualization technique
  that aims to go beyond the simple visualization of the image regions
  (or, more generally, input variables) responsible for a network
  prediction. Instead, they aim to expose the deliberations carried
  by the network to arrive at that prediction, by uncovering the
  insecurities of the network about the latter. The
  explanation consists of a list of insecurities, each composed of
  1) an image region (more generally, a set of input variables), and 2)
  an ambiguity formed by the pair of classes responsible for the network
  uncertainty about the region. Since insecurity detection requires
  quantifying the difficulty of network predictions, deliberative
  explanations combine ideas from the literatures on visual explanations and
  assessment of classification difficulty. More specifically,
  the proposed implementation
  combines attributions with respect to both class
  predictions and a difficulty score.
  An evaluation protocol that leverages object recognition (CUB200)
  and scene classification (ADE20K) datasets that combine part and
  attribute annotations is also introduced to evaluate the accuracy of
  deliberative explanations. Finally, an experimental evaluation shows that
  the most accurate explanations are achieved by combining non self-referential
  difficulty scores and second-order attributions. The resulting
  insecurities are shown to correlate with regions of attributes that

No-Regret Learning in Unknown Games with Correlated Payoffs,"Pier Giuseppe Sessa, Ilija Bogunovic, Maryam Kamgarpour, Andreas Krause","We consider the problem of learning to play a repeated multi-agent game with an unknown reward function. Single player online learning algorithms attain strong regret bounds when provided with full information feedback, which unfortunately is unavailable in many real-world scenarios. Bandit feedback alone, i.e., observing outcomes only for the selected action, yields substantially worse performance.  In this paper, we consider a natural model where, besides a noisy measurement of the obtained reward, the player can also observe the opponents' actions. This feedback model, together with a regularity assumption on the reward function, allows us to exploit the correlations among different game outcomes by means of Gaussian processes (GPs). We propose a novel confidence-bound based bandit algorithm GP-MW, which utilizes the GP model for the reward function and runs a multiplicative weight (MW) method. We obtain novel kernel-dependent regret bounds that are comparable to the known bounds in the full information setting, while substantially improving upon the existing bandit results.

Pareto Multi-Task Learning,"Xi Lin, Hui-Ling Zhen, Zhenhua Li, Qing-Fu Zhang, Sam Kwong","Multi-task learning is a powerful method for solving multiple correlated tasks simultaneously. However, it is often impossible to find one single solution to optimize all the tasks, since different tasks might conflict with each other. Recently, a novel method is proposed to find one single Pareto optimal solution with good trade-off among different tasks by casting multi-task learning as multiobjective optimization. In this paper, we generalize this idea and propose a novel Pareto multi-task learning algorithm (Pareto MTL) to find a set of well-distributed Pareto solutions which can represent different trade-offs among different tasks. The proposed algorithm first formulates a multi-task learning problem as a multiobjective optimization problem, and then decomposes the multiobjective optimization problem into a set of constrained subproblems with different trade-off preferences.

Semantic Conditioned Dynamic Modulation for Temporal Sentence Grounding in Videos,"Yitian Yuan, Lin Ma, Jingwen Wang, Wei Liu, Wenwu Zhu","Temporal sentence grounding in videos aims to detect and localize one target video segment, which semantically corresponds to a given sentence. Existing methods mainly tackle this task via matching and aligning semantics between a sentence and candidate video segments, while neglect the fact that the sentence information plays an important role in temporally correlating and composing the described contents in videos. In this paper, we propose a novel semantic conditioned dynamic modulation (SCDM) mechanism, which relies on the sentence semantics to modulate the temporal convolution operations for better correlating and composing the sentence related video contents over time. More importantly, the proposed SCDM performs dynamically with respect to the diverse video contents so as to establish a more precise matching relationship between sentence and video, thereby improving the temporal grounding accuracy. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-arts with clear margins, illustrating the ability of SCDM to better associate and localize relevant video contents for temporal sentence grounding.

Channel Gating Neural Networks,"Weizhe Hua, Yuan Zhou, Christopher M. De Sa, Zhiru Zhang, G. Edward Suh","This paper introduces channel gating, a dynamic, fine-grained, and hardware－efficient pruning scheme to reduce the computation cost for convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Channel gating identifies regions in the features that contribute less to the classification result, and skips the computation on a subset of the input channels for these ineffective regions. Unlike static network pruning, channel gating optimizes CNN inference at run-time by exploiting input-specific characteristics, which allows substantially reducing the compute cost with almost no accuracy loss. We experimentally show that applying channel gating in state-of-the-art networks achieves 2.7-8.0x reduction in floating-point operations (FLOPs) and 2.0-4.4x reduction in off-chip memory accesses with a minimal accuracy loss on CIFAR-10. Combining our method with knowledge distillation reduces the compute cost of ResNet-18 by 2.6x without accuracy drop on ImageNet. We further demonstrate that channel gating can be realized in hardware efficiently. Our approach exhibits sparsity patterns that are well-suited to dense systolic arrays with minimal additional hardware. We have designed an accelerator for channel gating networks, which can be implemented using either FPGAs or ASICs. Running a quantized ResNet-18 model for ImageNet, our accelerator achieves an encouraging speedup of 2.4x on average, with a theoretical FLOP reduction of 2.8x.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/68b1fbe7f16e4ae3024973f12f3cb313-Paper.pdf,2019,"channel, gating, accuracy, cost, hardware, networks, reduction, 18, 4x, accelerator","channel, gating, accuracy, output, pruning, gate, reduction, cgnet, input, path","{'gating': 0.6842486418726835, 'channel': 0.6014275613941047, 'networks': 0.2916236311506053, 'neural': 0.2916236311506053}","{'gating': 0.4868848179116419, 'channel': 0.4064961269267427, 'hardware': 0.18605228980284622, '4x': 0.16773762919454205, 'accelerator': 0.16773762919454205, 'reduction': 0.15376878457217477, '18': 0.1389890787865888, 'pruning': 0.1354987089755809, 'cost': 0.12936762838602267, 'resnet': 0.12615715262192784}"
Rethinking Generative Mode Coverage: A Pointwise Guaranteed Approach,"Peilin Zhong, Yuchen Mo, Chang Xiao, Pengyu Chen, Changxi Zheng","Many generative models have to combat missing modes. The conventional wisdom to this end is by reducing through training a statistical distance (such as f -divergence) between the generated distribution and provided data distribution. But this is more of a heuristic than a guarantee. The statistical distance measures a global, but not local, similarity between two distributions. Even if it is small, it does not imply a plausible mode coverage. Rethinking this problem from a game-theoretic perspective, we show that a complete mode coverage is firmly attainable. If a generative model can approximate a data distribution moderately well under a global statistical distance measure, then we will be able to find a mixture of generators that collectively covers every data point and thus every mode, with a lower-bounded generation probability. Constructing the generator mixture has a connection to the multiplicative weights update rule, upon which we propose our algorithm. We prove that our algorithm guarantees complete mode coverage. And our experiments on real and synthetic datasets confirm better mode coverage over recent approaches, ones that also use generator mixtures but rely on global statistical distances.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/68d13cf26c4b4f4f932e3eff990093ba-Paper.pdf,2019,"mode, coverage, statistical, data, distance, distribution, global, algorithm, complete, every","distribution, data, generator, coverage, mode, generative, mixture, distance, generators, gt","{'coverage': 0.42340335381720234, 'guaranteed': 0.42340335381720234, 'mode': 0.42340335381720234, 'pointwise': 0.42340335381720234, 'rethinking': 0.36195752586747143, 'approach': 0.29748769644773965, 'generative': 0.2518059169985808}","{'mode': 0.4442147169007292, 'coverage': 0.3880493391786483, 'statistical': 0.23729405763098435, 'global': 0.1919414695824219, 'distance': 0.18867642950320723, 'mixture': 0.16134710393125926, 'generator': 0.1544667558200907, 'complete': 0.1496839759168659, 'every': 0.1479546331717006, 'distribution': 0.14014227174978502}"

A Domain Agnostic Measure for Monitoring and Evaluating GANs,"Paulina Grnarova, Kfir Y. Levy, Aurelien Lucchi, Nathanael Perraudin, Ian Goodfellow, Thomas Hofmann, Andreas Krause","Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown remarkable results in modeling complex distributions, but their evaluation remains an unsettled issue. Evaluations are essential for: (i) relative assessment of different models and (ii) monitoring the progress of a single model throughout training. The latter cannot be determined by simply inspecting the generator and discriminator loss curves as they behave non-intuitively. We leverage the notion of duality gap from game theory to propose a measure that addresses both (i) and (ii) at a low computational cost. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of this measure to rank different GAN models and capture the typical GAN failure scenarios, including mode collapse and non-convergent behaviours. This evaluation metric also provides meaningful monitoring on the progression of the loss during training.

Enabling hyperparameter optimization in sequential autoencoders for spiking neural data,"Mohammad Reza Keshtkaran, Chethan Pandarinath","Continuing advances in neural interfaces have enabled simultaneous monitoring of spiking activity from hundreds to thousands of neurons. To interpret these large-scale data, several methods have been proposed to infer latent dynamic structure from high-dimensional datasets. One recent line of work uses recurrent neural networks in a sequential autoencoder (SAE) framework to uncover dynamics. SAEs are an appealing option for modeling nonlinear dynamical systems, and enable a precise link between neural activity and behavior on a single-trial basis. However, the very large parameter count and complexity of SAEs relative to other models has caused concern that SAEs may only perform well on very large training sets. We hypothesized that with a method to systematically optimize hyperparameters (HPs), SAEs might perform well even in cases of limited training data. Such a breakthrough would greatly extend their applicability. However, we find that SAEs applied to spiking neural data are prone to a particular form of overfitting that cannot be detected using standard validation metrics, which prevents standard HP searches. We develop and test two potential solutions: an alternate validation method (“sample validation”) and a novel regularization method (“coordinated dropout”). These innovations prevent overfitting quite effectively, and allow us to test whether SAEs can achieve good performance on limited data through large-scale HP optimization. When applied to data from motor cortex recorded while monkeys made reaches in various directions, large-scale HP optimization allowed SAEs to better maintain performance for small dataset sizes. Our results should greatly extend the applicability of SAEs in extracting latent dynamics from sparse, multidimensional data, such as neural population spiking activity.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/6948bd44c91acd2b54ecdd1b132f10fb-Paper.pdf,2019,"saes, data, large, neural, activity, hp, method, scale, spiking, validation","data, models, performance, hp, model, hps, training, validation, lfads, neural","{'enabling': 0.46244212995847395, 'spiking': 0.4376733545980551, 'hyperparameter': 0.39533085344647145, 'autoencoders': 0.37056207808605257, 'sequential': 0.3641258869268113, 'data': 0.26580964389514866, 'optimization': 0.24269197759757954, 'neural': 0.19709071364237096}","{'saes': 0.6258409390026319, 'hp': 0.234690352125987, 'spiking': 0.1958522680168388, 'validation': 0.17436335975916656, 'activity': 0.16657212458629161, 'large': 0.1410557397257772, 'data': 0.12740183271583727, 'neural': 0.11856289751630156, 'overfitting': 0.11777390051165254, 'greatly': 0.11222943092092427}"

As the proposed grid saliency allows to spatially disentangle the object and its context, we specifically explore its potential to produce context explanations for semantic segmentation networks, discovering which context most influences the class predictions inside a target object area.

Extreme Classification in Log Memory using Count-Min Sketch: A Case Study of Amazon Search with 50M Products,"Tharun Kumar Reddy Medini, Qixuan Huang, Yiqiu Wang, Vijai Mohan, Anshumali Shrivastava","In the last decade, it has been shown that many hard AI tasks, especially in NLP, can be naturally modeled as extreme classification problems leading to improved precision. However, such models are prohibitively expensive to train due to the memory bottleneck in the last layer. For example, a reasonable softmax layer for the dataset of interest in this paper can easily reach well beyond 100 billion parameters (> 400 GB memory). To alleviate this problem, we present Merged-Average Classifiers via Hashing (MACH), a generic $K$-classification algorithm where memory provably scales at $O(\log K)$ without any assumption on the relation between classes. MACH is subtly a count-min sketch structure in disguise, which uses universal hashing to reduce classification with a large number of classes to few embarrassingly parallel and independent classification tasks with a small (constant) number of classes. MACH naturally provides a technique for zero communication model parallelism. We experiment with 6 datasets; some multiclass and some multilabel, and show consistent improvement in precision and recall metrics compared to respective baselines. In particular, we train an end-to -end deep classifier on a private product search dataset sampled from Amazon Search Engine with 70 million queries and 49.46 million documents. MACH outperforms, by a significant margin, the state-of-the-art extreme classification models deployed on commercial search engines: Parabel and dense embedding models. Our largest model has 6.4 billion parameters and trains in less than 35 hrs on a single p3.16x machine. Our training times are 7-10x faster, and our memory footprints are 2-4x smaller than the best baselines.

Selecting the independent coordinates of manifolds with large aspect ratios,"Yu-Chia Chen, Marina Meila","Many manifold embedding algorithms fail apparently when the data manifold has a large aspect ratio (such as a long, thin strip). Here, we formulate success and failure in terms of finding a smooth embedding, showing also that the problem is pervasive and more complex than previously recognized.

DM2C: Deep Mixed-Modal Clustering,"Yangbangyan Jiang, Qianqian Xu, Zhiyong Yang, Xiaochun Cao, Qingming Huang","Data exhibited with multiple modalities are ubiquitous in real-world clustering tasks. Most existing methods, however, pose a strong assumption that the pairing information for modalities is available for all instances. In this paper, we consider a more challenging task where each instance is represented in only one modality, which we call mixed-modal data. Without any extra pairing supervision across modalities, it is difficult to find a universal semantic space for all of them. To tackle this problem, we present an adversarial learning framework for clustering with mixed-modal data. Instead of transforming all the samples into a joint modality-independent space, our framework learns the mappings across individual modal spaces by virtue of cycle-consistency. Through these mappings, we could easily unify all the samples into a single modal space and perform the clustering. Evaluations on several real-world mixed-modal datasets could demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/6a4d5952d4c018a1c1af9fa590a10dda-Paper.pdf,2019,"modal, clustering, data, framework, mixed, modalities, space, across, could, mappings","modal, data, clustering, modality, mixed, modalities, learning, samples, auto, representations","{'dm2c': 0.5575009590676754, 'mixed': 0.49002134862744, 'modal': 0.47659440104482165, 'clustering': 0.3917060991256373, 'deep': 0.2617171513838387}","{'modal': 0.48583647415908754, 'modalities': 0.28418152964183785, 'mixed': 0.2720890101652392, 'pairing': 0.24434178461551825, 'clustering': 0.240837822875738, 'modality': 0.2108920951043427, 'mappings': 0.20687528385988582, 'could': 0.15866342335014877, 'space': 0.15193226576339428, 'framework': 0.14342614084555563}"
An Improved Analysis of Training Over-parameterized Deep Neural Networks,"Difan Zou, Quanquan Gu","A recent line of research has shown that gradient-based algorithms with random initialization can converge to the global minima of the training loss for over-parameterized (i.e., sufficiently wide) deep neural networks. However, the condition on the width of the neural network to ensure the global convergence is very stringent, which is often a high-degree polynomial in the training sample size $n$ (e.g., $O(n^{24})$). In this paper, we provide an improved analysis of the global convergence of (stochastic) gradient descent for training deep neural networks, which only requires a milder over-parameterization condition than previous work in terms of the training sample size and other problem-dependent parameters. The main technical contributions of our analysis include (a) a tighter gradient lower bound that leads to a faster convergence of the algorithm, and (b) a sharper characterization of the trajectory length of the algorithm.

Contextual Bandits with Cross-Learning,"Santiago Balseiro, Negin Golrezaei, Mohammad Mahdian, Vahab Mirrokni, Jon Schneider","In the classical contextual bandits problem, in each round $t$, a learner observes some
context $c$, chooses some action $a$ to perform, and receives some reward $r_{a,t}(c)$. We consider the variant of this problem where in addition to receiving the reward $r_{a,t}(c)$, the learner also learns the values of $r_{a,t}(c')$ for all other contexts $c'$; i.e., the rewards that would have been achieved by performing that action under different contexts. This variant arises in several strategic settings, such as learning how to bid in non-truthful repeated auctions (in this setting the context is the decision maker's private valuation for each auction). We call this problem the contextual bandits problem with cross-learning.
 
The best algorithms for the classical contextual bandits problem achieve $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{CKT})$ regret against all stationary policies, where $C$ is the number of contexts, $K$ the number of actions, and $T$ the number of rounds. We demonstrate algorithms for the contextual bandits problem with cross-learning that remove the dependence on $C$ and achieve regret $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{KT})$ (when contexts are stochastic with known distribution), $\tilde{O}(K^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ (when contexts are  stochastic with unknown distribution), and $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{KT})$ (when contexts are adversarial but rewards are stochastic). We simulate our algorithms on real auction data from an ad exchange running first-price auctions (showing that they outperform traditional contextual bandit algorithms).",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/6aadca7bd86c4743e6724f9607256126-Paper.pdf,2019,"contexts, problem, contextual, algorithms, bandits, tilde, learning, number, r_, sqrt","regret, problem, bandits, contexts, contextual, learning, algorithm, algorithms, cross, rewards","{'cross': 0.5931426560853382, 'contextual': 0.5843436215681254, 'bandits': 0.4986605376100796, 'learning': 0.24096055630559995}","{'contexts': 0.4038480902855218, 'contextual': 0.33045082942280174, 'r_': 0.2901895798649965, 'bandits': 0.2578269746995546, 'tilde': 0.2502410828512425, 'kt': 0.17574600422018863, 'sqrt': 0.16757409261056677, 'auction': 0.16538414479321434, 'auctions': 0.1614447486700923, 'problem': 0.1606785928207973}"

A state-space model for inferring effective connectivity of latent neural dynamics from simultaneous EEG/fMRI,"Tao Tu, John Paisley, Stefan Haufe, Paul Sajda","Inferring effective connectivity between spatially segregated brain regions is important for understanding human brain dynamics in health and disease. Non-invasive neuroimaging modalities, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), are often used to make measurements and infer connectivity. However most studies do not consider integrating the two modalities even though each is an indirect measure of the latent neural dynamics and each has its own spatial and/or temporal limitations. In this study, we develop a linear state-space model to infer the effective connectivity in a distributed brain network based on simultaneously recorded EEG and fMRI data. Our method first identifies task-dependent and subject-dependent regions of interest (ROI) based on the analysis of fMRI data. Directed influences between the latent neural states at these ROIs are then modeled as a multivariate autogressive (MVAR) process driven by various exogenous inputs. The latent neural dynamics give rise to the observed scalp EEG measurements via a biophysically informed linear EEG forward model. We use a mean-field variational Bayesian approach to infer the posterior distribution of latent states and model parameters. The performance of the model was evaluated on two sets of simulations. Our results emphasize the importance of obtaining accurate spatial localization of ROIs from fMRI.

A Solvable High-Dimensional Model of GAN,"Chuang Wang, Hong Hu, Yue Lu","We present a theoretical analysis of the training process for a single-layer GAN fed by high-dimensional input data. The training dynamics of the proposed model at both microscopic and macroscopic scales can be exactly analyzed in the high-dimensional limit. In particular, we prove that the macroscopic quantities measuring the quality of the training process converge to a deterministic process characterized by an ordinary differential equation (ODE), whereas the microscopic states containing all the detailed weights remain stochastic, whose dynamics can be described by a stochastic differential equation (SDE). This analysis provides a new perspective different from recent analyses in the limit of small learning rate, where the microscopic state is always considered deterministic, and the contribution of noise is ignored. From our analysis, we show that the level of the background noise is essential to the convergence of the training process: setting the noise level too strong leads to failure of feature recovery, whereas setting the noise too weak causes oscillation.

On The Classification-Distortion-Perception Tradeoff,"Dong Liu, Haochen Zhang, Zhiwei Xiong","Signal degradation is ubiquitous, and computational restoration of degraded signal has been investigated for many years. Recently, it is reported that the capability of signal restoration is fundamentally limited by the so-called perception-distortion tradeoff, i.e. the distortion and the perceptual difference between the restored signal and the ideal ""original"" signal cannot be made both minimal simultaneously. Distortion corresponds to signal fidelity and perceptual difference corresponds to perceptual naturalness, both of which are important metrics in practice. Besides, there is another dimension worthy of consideration--the semantic quality of the restored signal, i.e. the utility of the signal for recognition purpose. In this paper, we extend the previous perception-distortion tradeoff to the case of classification-distortion-perception (CDP) tradeoff, where we introduced the classification error rate of the restored signal in addition to distortion and perceptual difference. In particular, we consider the classification error rate achieved on the restored signal using a predefined classifier as a representative metric for semantic quality. We rigorously prove the existence of the CDP tradeoff, i.e. the distortion, perceptual difference, and classification error rate cannot be made all minimal simultaneously. We also provide both simulation and experimental results to showcase the CDP tradeoff.

In this paper, we propose a framework named E^3Outlier, which can perform UOD in a both effective and end-to-end manner: First, instead of the commonly-used autoencoders in previous end-to-end UOD methods, E^3Outlier for the first time leverages a discriminative DNN for better representation learning, by using surrogate supervision to create multiple pseudo classes from original unlabelled data. Next, unlike classic UOD that utilizes data characteristics like density or proximity, we exploit a novel property named inlier priority to enable end-to-end UOD by discriminative DNN. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that the intrinsic class imbalance of inliers/outliers will make the network prioritize minimizing inliers' loss when inliers/outliers are indiscriminately fed into the network for training, which enables us to differentiate outliers directly from DNN's outputs. Finally, based on inlier priority, we propose the negative entropy based score as a simple and effective outlierness measure. Extensive evaluations show that E^3Outlier significantly advances UOD performance by up to 30% AUROC against state-of-the-art counterparts, especially on relatively difficult benchmarks.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/6c4bb406b3e7cd5447f7a76fd7008806-Paper.pdf,2019,"end, uod, dnn, 3outlier, data, inliers, outliers, based, discriminative, effective","uod, inliers, outliers, cae, end, ssd, e3outlier, data, based, performance","{'end': 0.5612883563823647, 'inlier': 0.3435585513070669, 'priority': 0.3435585513070669, 'discriminative': 0.30197441261000996, 'effective': 0.30197441261000996, 'outlier': 0.2937000902345388, 'detection': 0.23271720550691347, 'unsupervised': 0.23271720550691347, 'network': 0.20126001894897116, 'via': 0.17729466767455512}","{'uod': 0.5239735410625469, 'end': 0.3442988576616436, 'dnn': 0.27991210382104886, '3outlier': 0.26198677053127345, 'inliers': 0.2379985254855284, 'outliers': 0.2062877904125155, 'priority': 0.17465784702084897, 'inlier': 0.1653030311476017, 'named': 0.12668135692935892, 'discriminative': 0.10997923555635515}"

In this class, players control the inputs of a smooth function whose output is being applied to a bilinear zero-sum game. This class of games is motivated by the  indirect nature of the competition in
Generative Adversarial Networks, where players control the parameters of a neural network while the actual competition happens between the distributions that the generator and discriminator capture. We establish theoretically, that depending on the specific instance of the problem gradient-descent-ascent dynamics  can exhibit a variety of behaviors antithetical to convergence to the game theoretically meaningful min-max solution.

End-to-End Learning on 3D Protein Structure for Interface Prediction,"Raphael Townshend, Rishi Bedi, Patricia Suriana, Ron Dror","Despite an explosion in the number of experimentally determined, atomically detailed structures of biomolecules, many critical tasks in structural biology remain data-limited.  Whether performance in such tasks can be improved by using large repositories of tangentially related structural data remains an open question.  To address this question, we focused on a central problem in biology: predicting how proteins interact with one another—that is, which surfaces of one protein bind to those of another protein.  We built a training dataset, the Database of Interacting Protein Structures (DIPS), that contains biases but is two orders of magnitude larger than those used previously.  We found that these biases significantly degrade the performance of existing methods on gold-standard data.  Hypothesizing that assumptions baked into the hand-crafted features on which these methods depend were the source of the problem, we developed the first end-to-end learning model for protein interface prediction, the Siamese Atomic Surfacelet Network (SASNet).  Using only spatial coordinates and identities of atoms, SASNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods trained on gold-standard structural data, even when trained on only 3% of our new dataset.

Scalable Global Optimization via Local Bayesian Optimization,"David Eriksson, Michael Pearce, Jacob Gardner, Ryan D. Turner, Matthias Poloczek","Bayesian optimization has recently emerged as a popular method for the sample-efficient optimization of expensive black-box functions. However, the application to high-dimensional problems with several thousand observations remains challenging, and on difficult problems Bayesian optimization is often not competitive with other paradigms. In this paper we take the view that this is due to the implicit homogeneity of the global probabilistic models and an overemphasized exploration that results from global acquisition. This motivates the design of a local probabilistic approach for global optimization of large-scale high-dimensional problems. We propose the TuRBO algorithm that fits a collection of local models and performs a principled global allocation of samples across these models via an implicit bandit approach.

Positional Normalization,"Boyi Li, Felix Wu, Kilian Q.

Our approach, which we refer to as Positional Normalization (PONO), normalizes exclusively across channels, which allows us to capture structural information of the input image in the first and second moments.

Beyond Vector Spaces: Compact Data Representation as Differentiable Weighted Graphs,"Denis Mazur, Vage Egiazarian, Stanislav Morozov, Artem Babenko","Learning useful representations is a key ingredient to the success of modern machine learning. Currently, representation learning mostly relies on embedding data into Euclidean space. However, recent work has shown that data in some domains is better modeled by non-euclidean metric spaces, and inappropriate geometry can result in inferior performance. In this paper, we aim to eliminate the inductive bias imposed by the embedding space geometry. Namely, we propose to map data into more general non-vector metric spaces: a weighted graph with a shortest path distance. By design, such graphs can model arbitrary geometry with a proper configuration of edges and weights. Our main contribution is PRODIGE: a method that learns a weighted graph representation of data end-to-end by gradient descent.

Category Anchor-Guided Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation,"Qiming ZHANG, Jing Zhang, Wei Liu, Dacheng Tao","Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to enhance the generalization capability of a certain model from a source domain to a target domain. UDA is of particular significance since no extra effort is devoted to annotating target domain samples. However, the different data distributions in the two domains, or \emph{domain shift/discrepancy}, inevitably compromise the UDA performance. Although there has been a progress in matching the marginal distributions between two domains, the classifier favors the source domain features and makes incorrect predictions on the target domain due to category-agnostic feature alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel category anchor-guided (CAG) UDA model for semantic segmentation, which explicitly enforces category-aware feature alignment to learn shared discriminative features and classifiers simultaneously. First, the category-wise centroids of the source domain features are used as guided anchors to identify the active features in the target domain and also assign them pseudo-labels. Then, we leverage an anchor-based pixel-level distance loss and a discriminative loss to drive the intra-category features closer and the inter-category features further apart, respectively. Finally, we devise a stagewise training mechanism to reduce the error accumulation and adapt the proposed model progressively.

Novel positional encodings to enable tree-based transformers,"Vighnesh Shiv, Chris Quirk","Neural models optimized for tree-based problems are of great value in tasks like SQL query extraction and program synthesis.
On sequence-structured data, transformers have been shown to learn relationships across arbitrary pairs of positions more reliably than recurrent models.
Motivated by this property, we propose a method to extend transformers to tree-structured data, enabling sequence-to-tree, tree-to-sequence, and tree-to-tree mappings.
Our approach abstracts the transformer's sinusoidal positional encodings, allowing us to instead use a novel positional encoding scheme to represent node positions within trees.
We evaluated our model in tree-to-tree program translation and sequence-to-tree semantic parsing settings, achieving superior performance over both sequence-to-sequence transformers and state-of-the-art tree-based LSTMs on several datasets.

Algorithm-Dependent Generalization Bounds for Overparameterized Deep Residual Networks,"Spencer Frei, Yuan Cao, Quanquan Gu","The skip-connections used in residual networks have become a standard architecture choice in deep learning due to the increased generalization and stability of networks with this architecture, although there have been limited theoretical guarantees for this improved performance.   In this work, we analyze overparameterized deep residual networks trained by gradient descent following random initialization, and demonstrate that (i) the class of networks learned by gradient descent constitutes a small subset of the entire neural network function class, and (ii) this subclass of networks is sufficiently large to guarantee small training error.  By showing (i) we are able to demonstrate that deep residual networks trained with gradient descent have a small generalization gap between training and test error, and together with (ii) this guarantees that the test error will be small.

Scalable Gromov-Wasserstein Learning for Graph Partitioning and Matching,"Hongteng Xu, Dixin Luo, Lawrence Carin","We propose a scalable Gromov-Wasserstein learning (S-GWL) method and establish a novel and theoretically-supported paradigm for large-scale graph analysis.
The proposed method is based on the fact that Gromov-Wasserstein discrepancy is a pseudometric on graphs. 
Given two graphs, the optimal transport associated with their Gromov-Wasserstein discrepancy provides the correspondence between their nodes and achieves graph matching. 
When one of the graphs is a predefined graph with isolated but self-connected nodes ($i.e.$, disconnected graph), the optimal transport indicates the clustering structure of the other graph and achieves graph partitioning. 
Further, we extend our method to multi-graph partitioning and matching by learning a Gromov-Wasserstein barycenter graph for multiple observed graphs. 
Our method combines a recursive $K$-partition mechanism with a warm-start proximal gradient algorithm, whose time complexity is $\mathcal{O}(K(E+V)\log_K V)$ for graphs with $V$ nodes and $E$ edges. 
To our knowledge, our method is the first attempt to make Gromov-Wasserstein discrepancy applicable to large-scale graph analysis and unify graph partitioning and matching into the same framework.

Riemannian batch normalization for SPD neural networks,"Daniel Brooks, Olivier Schwander, Frederic Barbaresco, Jean-Yves Schneider, Matthieu Cord","Covariance matrices have attracted attention for machine learning applications due
to their capacity to capture interesting structure in the data. The main challenge
is that one needs to take into account the particular geometry of the Riemannian
manifold of symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices they belong to. In the con-
text of deep networks, several architectures for these matrices have recently been
proposed. In our article, we introduce a Riemannian batch normalization (batch-
norm) algorithm, which generalizes the one used in Euclidean nets. This novel
layer makes use of geometric operations on the manifold, notably the Riemannian
barycenter, parallel transport and non-linear structured matrix transformations. We
derive a new manifold-constrained gradient descent algorithm working in the space
of SPD matrices, allowing to learn the batchnorm layer. We validate our proposed
approach with experiments in three different contexts on diverse data types: a
drone recognition dataset from radar observations, and on emotion and action

the Riemannian batchnorm systematically gives better classification performance

A unified theory for the origin of grid cells through the lens of pattern formation,"Ben Sorscher, Gabriel Mel, Surya Ganguli, Samuel Ocko","Grid cells in the brain fire in strikingly regular hexagonal patterns across space. There are currently two seemingly unrelated frameworks for understanding these patterns. Mechanistic models account for hexagonal firing fields as the result of pattern-forming dynamics in a recurrent neural network with hand-tuned center-surround connectivity. Normative models specify a neural architecture, a learning rule, and a navigational task, and observe that grid-like firing fields emerge due to the constraints of solving this task. Here we provide an analytic theory that unifies the two perspectives by casting the learning dynamics of neural networks trained on navigational tasks as a pattern forming dynamical system. This theory provides insight into the optimal solutions of diverse formulations of the normative task, and shows that symmetries in the representation of space correctly predict the structure of learned firing fields in trained neural networks. Further, our theory proves that a nonnegativity constraint on firing rates induces a symmetry-breaking mechanism which favors hexagonal firing fields.  We extend this theory to the case of learning multiple grid maps and demonstrate that optimal solutions consist of a hierarchy of maps with increasing length scales. These results unify previous accounts of grid cell firing and provide a novel framework for predicting the learned representations of recurrent neural networks.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/6e7d5d259be7bf56ed79029c4e621f44-Paper.pdf,2019,"firing, neural, fields, grid, theory, hexagonal, learning, networks, task, dynamics","grid, cell, place, hexagonal, patterns, dynamics, like, cells, constraint, grids","{'formation': 0.3787374887741412, 'origin': 0.3787374887741412, 'pattern': 0.3787374887741412, 'cells': 0.3584520018509272, 'grid': 0.3584520018509272, 'lens': 0.3584520018509272, 'theory': 0.3034882459819166, 'unified': 0.3034882459819166}","{'firing': 0.5297273922644521, 'grid': 0.2829858708508353, 'hexagonal': 0.26486369613222605, 'fields': 0.24345913642980327, 'navigational': 0.17657579742148402, 'theory': 0.16973058690665674, 'normative': 0.1604080211284106, 'forming': 0.13681225720324472, 'neural': 0.13380612784396062, 'pattern': 0.13291569216564858}"
Functional Adversarial Attacks,"Cassidy Laidlaw, Soheil Feizi","We propose functional adversarial attacks, a novel class of threat models for crafting adversarial examples to fool machine learning models. Unlike a standard lp-ball threat model, a functional adversarial threat model allows only a single function to be used to perturb input features to produce an adversarial example. For example, a functional adversarial attack applied on colors of an image can change all red pixels simultaneously to light red. Such global uniform changes in images can be less perceptible than perturbing pixels of the image individually. For simplicity, we refer to functional adversarial attacks on image colors as ReColorAdv, which is the main focus of our experiments. We show that functional threat models can be combined with existing additive (lp) threat models to generate stronger threat models that allow both small, individual perturbations and large, uniform changes to an input. Moreover, we prove that such combinations encompass perturbations that would not be allowed in either constituent threat model. In practice, ReColorAdv can significantly reduce the accuracy of a ResNet-32 trained on CIFAR-10. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, combining ReColorAdv with other attacks leads to the strongest existing attack even after adversarial training.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/6e923226e43cd6fac7cfe1e13ad000ac-Paper.pdf,2019,"adversarial, threat, functional, models, attacks, image, model, recoloradv, attack, changes","threat, adversarial, model, attacks, recoloradv, models, functional, attack, color, image","{'attacks': 0.6536791010162333, 'functional': 0.6167730576745931, 'adversarial': 0.43851411405032603}","{'threat': 0.536626982556058, 'functional': 0.30347802982636335, 'adversarial': 0.2888722692519013, 'recoloradv': 0.2815402202392827, 'attacks': 0.17728134594827594, 'red': 0.1705077375877692, 'colors': 0.16045472263624672, 'lp': 0.15332199501601657, 'pixels': 0.15332199501601657, 'models': 0.1356209897460403}"

We depart from the common practice of defining a set of arbitrary search ranges a priori by considering search space geometries that are learnt from historical data.

Learning from Trajectories via Subgoal Discovery,"Sujoy Paul, Jeroen Vanbaar, Amit Roy-Chowdhury","Learning to solve complex goal-oriented tasks with sparse terminal-only rewards often requires an enormous number of samples. In such cases, using a set of expert trajectories could help to learn faster. However, Imitation Learning (IL) via supervised pre-training with these trajectories may not perform as well and generally requires additional finetuning with expert-in-the-loop. In this paper, we propose an approach which uses the expert trajectories and learns to decompose the complex main task into smaller sub-goals. We learn a function which partitions the state-space into sub-goals, which can then be used to design an extrinsic reward function.

Learning from brains how to regularize machines,"Zhe Li, Wieland Brendel, Edgar Walker, Erick Cobos, Taliah Muhammad, Jacob Reimer, Matthias Bethge, Fabian Sinz, Zachary Pitkow, Andreas Tolias","Despite impressive performance on numerous visual tasks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) --- unlike brains --- are often highly sensitive to small perturbations of their input, e.g. adversarial noise leading to erroneous decisions. We propose to regularize CNNs using large-scale neuroscience data to learn more robust neural features in terms of representational similarity. We presented natural images to mice and measured the responses of thousands of neurons from cortical visual areas. Next, we denoised the notoriously variable neural activity using strong predictive models trained on this large corpus of responses from the mouse visual system, and calculated the representational similarity for millions of pairs of images from the model's predictions. We then used the neural representation similarity to regularize CNNs trained on image classification by penalizing intermediate representations that deviated from neural ones. This preserved performance of baseline models when classifying images under standard benchmarks, while maintaining substantially higher performance compared to baseline or control models when classifying noisy images. Moreover, the models regularized with cortical representations also improved model robustness in terms of adversarial attacks. This demonstrates that regularizing with neural data can be an effective tool to create an inductive bias towards more robust inference.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/70117ee3c0b15a2950f1e82a215e812b-Paper.pdf,2019,"neural, images, models, cnns, performance, similarity, visual, adversarial, baseline, classifying","neural, model, similarity, images, models, responses, regularization, robustness, image, adversarial","{'brains': 0.5901121397878649, 'regularize': 0.5901121397878649, 'machines': 0.5186852899120694, 'learning': 0.1857441653964054}","{'cnns': 0.24187524233744181, 'images': 0.2326169511433525, 'classifying': 0.22336575486462032, 'similarity': 0.21756394663592057, 'neural': 0.21460999693862742, 'cortical': 0.2143970377017208, 'representational': 0.2017563408273748, 'visual': 0.19193907232910812, 'regularize': 0.18911564395302882, 'responses': 0.17534115687872445}"

A Debiased MDI Feature Importance Measure for Random Forests,"Xiao Li, Yu Wang, Sumanta Basu, Karl Kumbier, Bin Yu","Tree ensembles such as Random Forests have achieved impressive empirical success across a wide variety of applications. To understand how these models make predictions, people routinely turn to feature importance measures calculated from tree ensembles. It has long been known that Mean Decrease Impurity (MDI), one of the most widely used measures of feature importance, incorrectly assigns high importance to noisy features, leading to systematic bias in feature selection. In this paper, we address the feature selection bias of MDI from both theoretical and methodological perspectives. Based on the original definition of MDI by Breiman et al.  \cite{Breiman1984} for a single tree, we derive a tight non-asymptotic bound on the expected bias of MDI importance of noisy features, showing that deep trees have higher (expected) feature selection bias than shallow ones. However, it is not clear how to reduce the bias of MDI using its existing analytical expression. We derive a new analytical expression for MDI, and based on this new expression, we are able to propose a debiased MDI feature importance measure using out-of-bag samples, called MDI-oob. For both the simulated data and a genomic ChIP dataset, MDI-oob achieves state-of-the-art performance in feature selection from Random Forests for both deep and shallow trees.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/702cafa3bb4c9c86e4a3b6834b45aedd-Paper.pdf,2019,"mdi, feature, bias, importance, selection, expression, tree, analytical, based, deep","mdi, feature, features, importance, tree, oob, mn, samples, bias, noisy","{'mdi': 0.43542025615329727, 'debiased': 0.4120987942592318, 'forests': 0.3955519537145696, 'measure': 0.3827172270640768, 'importance': 0.3556836512758419, 'feature': 0.3428489246253491, 'random': 0.30593089974826365}","{'mdi': 0.6878176461897901, 'feature': 0.25373333285731486, 'importance': 0.21483039049090646, 'bias': 0.20639798345940819, 'expression': 0.17500684725653065, 'selection': 0.1704219559894432, 'oob': 0.15284836581995334, 'tree': 0.13497580008472224, 'forests': 0.13066645747204453, 'ensembles': 0.12247977509182648}"
Unsupervised Discovery of Temporal Structure in Noisy Data with Dynamical Components Analysis,"David Clark, Jesse Livezey, Kristofer Bouchard","Linear dimensionality reduction methods are commonly used to extract low-dimensional structure from high-dimensional data. However, popular methods disregard temporal structure, rendering them prone to extracting noise rather than meaningful dynamics when applied to time series data. At the same time, many successful unsupervised learning methods for temporal, sequential and spatial data extract features which are predictive of their surrounding context. Combining these approaches, we introduce Dynamical Components Analysis (DCA), a linear dimensionality reduction method which discovers a subspace of high-dimensional time series data with maximal predictive information, defined as the mutual information between the past and future. We test DCA on synthetic examples and demonstrate its superior ability to extract dynamical structure compared to commonly used linear methods. We also apply DCA to several real-world datasets, showing that the dimensions extracted by DCA are more useful than those extracted by other methods for predicting future states and decoding auxiliary variables. Overall, DCA robustly extracts dynamical structure in noisy, high-dimensional data while retaining the computational efficiency and geometric interpretability of linear dimensionality reduction methods.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/704cddc91e28d1a5517518b2f12bc321-Paper.pdf,2019,"methods, data, dca, dimensional, linear, structure, dimensionality, dynamical, extract, high","dca, time, dimensional, information, data, predictive, dynamics, methods, structure, gaussian","{'components': 0.4185368750374701, 'dynamical': 0.3886962895058658, 'discovery': 0.3543599182818899, 'noisy': 0.34820513799510155, 'temporal': 0.3245193327502856, 'structure': 0.2995495992620165, 'unsupervised': 0.2995495992620165, 'analysis': 0.2784605052260987, 'data': 0.25418759570791705}","{'dca': 0.5337902403518108, 'extract': 0.22285793578055124, 'dynamical': 0.2151443990117863, 'dimensionality': 0.20040847562297326, 'dimensional': 0.19243058586988454, 'methods': 0.1855253811535783, 'structure': 0.18348371380866385, 'reduction': 0.17781287603936433, 'linear': 0.16613857496682485, 'extracted': 0.1607221381496}"

Learning Temporal Pose Estimation from Sparsely-Labeled Videos,"Gedas Bertasius, Christoph Feichtenhofer, Du Tran, Jianbo Shi, Lorenzo Torresani","Modern approaches for multi-person pose estimation in video require large amounts of dense annotations. However, labeling every frame in a video is costly and labor intensive. To reduce the need for dense annotations, we propose a PoseWarper network that leverages training videos with sparse annotations (every k frames) to learn to perform dense temporal pose propagation and estimation. Given a pair of video frames---a labeled Frame A and an unlabeled Frame B---we train our model to predict human pose in Frame A using the features from Frame B by means of deformable convolutions to implicitly learn the pose warping between A and B. We demonstrate that we can leverage our trained PoseWarper for several applications. First, at inference time we can reverse the application direction of our network in order to propagate pose information from manually annotated frames to unlabeled frames. This makes it possible to generate pose annotations for the entire video given only a few manually-labeled frames. Compared to modern label propagation methods based on optical flow, our warping mechanism is much more compact (6M vs 39M parameters), and also more accurate (88.7% mAP vs 83.8% mAP). We also show that we can improve the accuracy of a pose estimator by training it on an augmented dataset obtained by adding our propagated poses to the original manual labels. Lastly, we can use our PoseWarper to aggregate temporal pose information from neighboring frames during inference. This allows us to obtain state-of-the-art pose detection results on PoseTrack2017 and PoseTrack2018 datasets.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/7137debd45ae4d0ab9aa953017286b20-Paper.pdf,2019,"pose, frames, frame, annotations, video, dense, posewarper, also, estimation, every","pose, frame, labeled, frames, video, posewarper, model, training, latexit, gt","{'sparsely': 0.4739463783402432, 'labeled': 0.4485614261105498, 'pose': 0.41658016854314445, 'videos': 0.41658016854314445, 'temporal': 0.3477993538463727, 'estimation': 0.28960390019672766, 'learning': 0.1491797381411332}","{'pose': 0.47628371034437067, 'frames': 0.3720920069212508, 'frame': 0.29026847219577595, 'annotations': 0.24438144702650083, 'posewarper': 0.2401189929155045, 'video': 0.20159875424134596, 'dense': 0.17620818387665912, 'warping': 0.1407034144375167, 'vs': 0.13684803675725907, 'manually': 0.11610738887831039}"
Learning Generalizable Device Placement Algorithms for Distributed Machine Learning,"ravichandra addanki, Shaileshh Bojja Venkatakrishnan, Shreyan Gupta, Hongzi Mao, Mohammad Alizadeh","We present Placeto, a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to
efficiently find device placements for distributed neural network training.Unlike prior approaches that only find a device placement for a specific computation graph, Placeto can learn generalizable device placement policies that can be applied to any graph.We propose two key ideas in our approach:
(1) we represent the policy as performing iterative placement improvements, rather than outputting a placement in one shot;
(2) we use graph embeddings to capture relevant information about the  structure of the computation graph, without relying on node labels for indexing.These ideas allow Placeto to train efficiently and generalize
to unseen graphs.Our experiments show that Placeto requires up to 6.1x

better than the best placements found by prior approaches.
Moreover, Placeto is able to learn a generalizable placement policy for any given family of graphs that can be used without any re-training to predict optimized placements for unseen graphs from the same family.This eliminates the huge overhead incurred by the prior RL approaches whose lack of generalizability necessitates re-training from scratch every time a new graph is to be placed.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/71560ce98c8250ce57a6a970c9991a5f-Paper.pdf,2019,"graph, placement, placeto, placements, training, approaches, device, find, graphs, prior","placement, placeto, graph, policy, device, node, rnn, training, based, graphs","{'device': 0.45430343381984806, 'generalizable': 0.45430343381984806, 'placement': 0.45430343381984806, 'machine': 0.32587331806242803, 'distributed': 0.3224431149074086, 'algorithms': 0.29811025470982855, 'learning': 0.2859938186729168}","{'placeto': 0.46147282569047215, 'placement': 0.419219076761978, 'placements': 0.3691782605523777, 'device': 0.21453157174186316, 'graph': 0.20561444196968467, 'generalizable': 0.1676876307047912, 'graphs': 0.15012244862880098, 'ideas': 0.1272538788090489, 'prior': 0.12563764461888274, 'find': 0.12149258398847804}"
Dynamic Incentive-Aware Learning: Robust Pricing in Contextual Auctions,"Negin Golrezaei, Adel Javanmard, Vahab Mirrokni","Motivated by pricing in ad exchange markets, we consider the problem  of  robust learning of reserve  prices against strategic  buyers in repeated contextual second-price auctions. Buyers' valuations \new{for} an item depend on the context  that describes the item.  However, the seller is not aware of  the relationship between the context  and buyers' valuations, i.e., buyers' preferences. The seller's goal is to design a learning policy to set reserve prices via observing the past sales data, and her objective is  to minimize her regret for revenue, where the regret  is computed against   a clairvoyant policy that knows buyers' heterogeneous  preferences. Given the seller's goal,  utility-maximizing buyers  have the incentive to bid untruthfully in order to manipulate the seller's learning policy.  We propose two learning policies that are robust to such strategic behavior. These policies use  the outcomes of the auctions, rather than the submitted bids, to estimate the preferences  while controlling the long-term effect of the outcome of each auction on the future reserve prices. The first policy called Contextual Robust Pricing (CORP) is designed for the setting where the market noise distribution is known to the seller and achieves a T-period regret  of  $O(d\log(Td) \log (T))$, where $d$ is the dimension of {the} contextual information.  The second policy, which is a variant of the first policy, is called Stable CORP (SCORP). This policy is tailored to the setting where  the market noise distribution is unknown to the seller and belongs to an ambiguity set.  We show that the SCORP policy has  a T-period regret  of  $O(\sqrt{d\log(Td)}\;T^{2/3})$.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/717d8b3d60d9eea997b35b02b6a4e867-Paper.pdf,2019,"policy, buyers, seller, learning, regret, contextual, log, preferences, prices, reserve","buyers, policy, buyer, reserve, period, ﬁrm, preference, distribution, seller, vectors","{'incentive': 0.44444236420902267, 'pricing': 0.41275478499187385, 'auctions': 0.4014449984324021, 'contextual': 0.3584476326557816, 'aware': 0.3534824164995103, 'dynamic': 0.3406021134882753, 'robust': 0.2822309533849271, 'learning': 0.14780984643826198}","{'buyers': 0.4135274043087552, 'seller': 0.3891461226309061, 'policy': 0.2924970588872809, 'reserve': 0.2276037403173293, 'prices': 0.21541309947840473, 'preferences': 0.16702402936932237, 'regret': 0.15660767515958723, 'contextual': 0.15550905336280624, 'corp': 0.15173582687821954, 'scorp': 0.15173582687821954}"

On the equivalence between graph isomorphism testing and function approximation with GNNs,"Zhengdao Chen, Soledad Villar, Lei Chen, Joan Bruna","Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved lots of success on graph-structured data. In light of this, there has been increasing interest in studying their representation power. One line of work focuses on the universal approximation of permutation-invariant functions by certain classes of GNNs, and another demonstrates the limitation of GNNs via graph isomorphism tests.Our work connects these two perspectives and proves their equivalence. We further develop a framework of the representation power of GNNs with the language of sigma-algebra, which incorporates both viewpoints. Using this framework, we compare the expressive power of different classes of GNNs as well as other methods on graphs. In particular, we prove that order-2 Graph G-invariant networks fail to distinguish non-isomorphic regular graphs with the same degree.

Information Competing Process for Learning Diversified Representations,"Jie Hu, Rongrong Ji, ShengChuan Zhang, Xiaoshuai Sun, Qixiang Ye, Chia-Wen Lin, Qi Tian","Learning representations with diversified information remains as an open problem. Towards learning diversified representations, a new approach, termed Information Competing Process (ICP), is proposed in this paper. Aiming to enrich the information carried by feature representations, ICP separates a representation into two parts with different mutual information constraints. The separated parts are forced to accomplish the downstream task independently in a competitive environment which prevents the two parts from learning what each other learned for the downstream task. Such competing parts are then combined synergistically to complete the task. By fusing representation parts learned competitively under different conditions, ICP facilitates obtaining diversified representations which contain rich information. Experiments on image classification and image reconstruction tasks demonstrate the great potential of ICP to learn discriminative and disentangled representations in both supervised and self-supervised learning settings.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/71f6278d140af599e06ad9bf1ba03cb0-Paper.pdf,2019,"information, parts, representations, icp, learning, diversified, task, competing, different, downstream","information, icp, representations, representation, mutual, supervised, log, task, eq, learning","{'competing': 0.5218155038351222, 'diversified': 0.5218155038351222, 'process': 0.4262577155599192, 'information': 0.3666331190036979, 'representations': 0.33514859166035194, 'learning': 0.16424706206790143}","{'icp': 0.4660762397133011, 'parts': 0.3980551611962756, 'diversified': 0.3175507419439452, 'representations': 0.2637429024250595, 'information': 0.23172852141107833, 'competing': 0.1754171492018952, 'downstream': 0.1529177375646121, 'task': 0.1366807072537761, 'supervised': 0.1198680339639938, 'synergistically': 0.11651905992832527}"
Individual Regret in Cooperative Nonstochastic Multi-Armed Bandits,"Yogev Bar-On, Yishay Mansour","We study agents communicating over an underlying network by exchanging messages, in order to optimize their individual regret in a common nonstochastic multi-armed bandit problem.

We present algorithms both for the case that the communication graph is known to all the agents, and for the case that the graph is unknown.

Distributional Policy Optimization: An Alternative Approach for Continuous Control,"Chen Tessler, Guy Tennenholtz, Shie Mannor","We identify a fundamental problem in policy gradient-based methods in continuous control. As policy gradient methods require the agent's underlying probability distribution, they limit policy representation to parametric distribution classes. We show that optimizing over such sets results in local movement in the action space and thus convergence to sub-optimal solutions. We suggest a novel distributional framework, able to represent arbitrary distribution functions over the continuous action space. Using this framework, we construct a generative scheme, trained using an off-policy actor-critic paradigm, which we call the Generative Actor Critic (GAC). Compared to policy gradient methods, GAC does not require knowledge of the underlying probability distribution, thereby overcoming these limitations.

Understanding the Representation Power of Graph Neural Networks in Learning Graph Topology,"Nima Dehmamy, Albert-Laszlo Barabasi, Rose Yu","To deepen our understanding of graph neural networks, we investigate the representation power of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) through the looking glass of graph moments, a key property of  graph topology encoding path of various lengths.
We find that GCNs are rather restrictive in learning graph moments. Without careful design, GCNs can fail miserably even with multiple layers and nonlinear activation functions.
We analyze theoretically the expressiveness of GCNs, arriving at a modular GCN design, using different propagation rules.

The Fairness of Risk Scores Beyond Classification: Bipartite Ranking and the XAUC Metric,"Nathan Kallus, Angela Zhou","Where machine-learned predictive risk scores inform high-stakes decisions, such as bail and sentencing in criminal justice, fairness has been a serious concern. Recent work has characterized the disparate impact that such risk scores can have when used for a binary classification task. This may not account, however, for the more diverse downstream uses of risk scores and their non-binary nature. To better account for this, in this paper, we investigate the fairness of predictive risk scores from the point of view of a bipartite ranking task, where one seeks to rank positive examples higher than negative ones. We introduce the xAUC disparity as a metric to assess the disparate impact of risk scores and define it as the difference in the probabilities of ranking a random positive example from one protected group above a negative one from another group and vice versa. We provide a decomposition of bipartite ranking loss into components that involve the discrepancy and components that involve pure predictive ability within each group. We use xAUC analysis to audit predictive risk scores for recidivism prediction, income prediction, and cardiac arrest prediction, where it describes disparities that are not evident from simply comparing within-group predictive performance.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/73e0f7487b8e5297182c5a711d20bf26-Paper.pdf,2019,"risk, scores, predictive, group, one, prediction, ranking, account, binary, bipartite","xauc, group, risk, scores, ranking, score, auc, pr, positive, black","{'scores': 0.39877488981578635, 'xauc': 0.39877488981578635, 'bipartite': 0.36226194011381213, 'ranking': 0.32574899041183786, 'risk': 0.32574899041183786, 'metric': 0.3139944460755632, 'fairness': 0.2962700807511073, 'beyond': 0.28923604070986364, 'classification': 0.26167287131272}","{'scores': 0.394350337161708, 'risk': 0.34273490601865253, 'predictive': 0.2814763705063677, 'group': 0.2399303376713664, 'ranking': 0.197175168580854, 'xauc': 0.19405875075948484, 'disparate': 0.1658962421165914, 'bipartite': 0.15852162148345528, 'impact': 0.1391989676972594, 'involve': 0.1391989676972594}"
Robust Principal Component Analysis with Adaptive Neighbors,"Rui Zhang, Hanghang Tong","Suppose certain data points are overly contaminated, then the existing principal component analysis (PCA) methods are frequently incapable of filtering out and eliminating the excessively polluted ones, which potentially lead to the functional degeneration of the corresponding models. To tackle the issue, we propose a general framework namely robust weight learning with adaptive neighbors (RWL-AN), via which adaptive weight vector is automatically obtained with both robustness and sparse neighbors. More significantly, the degree of the sparsity is steerable such that only exact k well-fitting samples with least reconstruction errors are activated during the optimization, while the residual samples, i.e., the extreme noised ones are eliminated for the global robustness.

Benefiting from such modeling, in searching, architecture parameters and network weights in the NAS model can be jointly optimized with the standard back-propagation, yielding an end-to-end learning mechanism for searching deep models in a large enough search space.

Near Neighbor: Who is the Fairest of Them All?,"Sariel Har-Peled, Sepideh Mahabadi","In this work we study a ""fair"" variant of the near neighbor problem.

We show that LSH based algorithms can be made fair, without a significant loss in efficiency. Specifically, we show an algorithm that reports a point $p$ in the $r$-neighborhood of a query $q$ with almost uniform probability.  The time to report such a point is proportional to $O(\dns(q.r) Q(n,c))$, and its space is $O(S(n,c))$, where $Q(n,c)$ and $S(n,c)$ are the query time and space of an LSH algorithm for $c$-approximate near neighbor, and $\dns(q,r)$ is a function of the local density around $q$.

Fast Structured Decoding for Sequence Models,"Zhiqing Sun, Zhuohan Li, Haoqing Wang, Di He, Zi Lin, Zhihong Deng","Autoregressive sequence models achieve state-of-the-art performance in domains like machine translation. However, due to the autoregressive factorization nature, these models suffer from heavy latency during inference. Recently, non-autoregressive sequence models were proposed to speed up the inference time. However, these models assume that the decoding process of each token is conditionally independent of others. Such a generation process sometimes makes the output sentence inconsistent, and thus the learned non-autoregressive models could only achieve inferior accuracy compared to their autoregressive counterparts. To improve then decoding consistency and reduce the inference cost at the same time, we propose to incorporate a structured inference module into the non-autoregressive models. Specifically, we design an efficient approximation for Conditional Random Fields (CRF) for non-autoregressive sequence models, and further propose a dynamic transition technique to model positional contexts in the CRF. Experiments in machine translation show that while increasing little latency (8~14ms, our model could achieve significantly better translation performance than previous non-autoregressive models on different translation datasets.

Efficiently escaping saddle points on manifolds,"Christopher Criscitiello, Nicolas Boumal","Smooth, non-convex optimization problems on Riemannian manifolds occur in machine learning as a result of orthonormality, rank or positivity constraints. First- and second-order necessary optimality conditions state that the Riemannian gradient must be zero, and the Riemannian Hessian must be positive semidefinite. Generalizing Jin et al.'s recent work on perturbed gradient descent (PGD) for optimization on linear spaces [How to Escape Saddle Points Efficiently (2017), Stochastic Gradient Descent Escapes Saddle Points Efficiently (2019)], we study a version of perturbed Riemannian gradient descent (PRGD) to show that necessary optimality conditions can be met approximately with high probability, without evaluating the Hessian. Specifically, for an arbitrary Riemannian manifold $\mathcal{M}$ of dimension $d$, a sufficiently smooth (possibly non-convex) objective function $f$, and under weak conditions on the retraction chosen to move on the manifold, with high probability, our version of PRGD produces a point with gradient smaller than $\epsilon$ and Hessian within $\sqrt{\epsilon}$ of being positive semidefinite in $O((\log{d})^4 / \epsilon^{2})$ gradient queries. This matches the complexity of PGD in the Euclidean case. Crucially, the dependence on dimension is low, which matters for large-scale applications including PCA and low-rank matrix completion, which both admit natural formulations on manifolds. The key technical idea is to generalize PRGD with a distinction between two types of gradient steps: ``steps on the manifold'' and ``perturbed steps in a tangent space of the manifold.''

Comparison Against Task Driven Artificial Neural Networks Reveals Functional Properties in Mouse Visual Cortex,"Jianghong Shi, Eric Shea-Brown, Michael Buice","Partially inspired by features of computation in visual cortex, deep neural networks compute hierarchical representations of their inputs.  While these networks have been highly successful in machine learning, it is still unclear to what extent they can aid our understanding of cortical function.  Several groups have developed metrics that provide a quantitative comparison between representations computed by networks and representations measured in cortex.  At the same time, neuroscience is well into an unprecedented phase of large-scale data collection, as evidenced by projects such as the Allen Brain Observatory.  Despite the magnitude of these efforts, in a given experiment only a fraction of units are recorded, limiting the information available about the cortical representation.  Moreover, only a finite number of stimuli can be shown to an animal over the course of a realistic experiment.  These limitations raise the question of how and whether metrics that compare representations of deep networks are meaningful on these data sets.  Here, we empirically quantify the capabilities and limitations of these metrics due to limited image and neuron sample spaces.  We find that the comparison procedure is robust to different choices of stimuli set and the level of sub-sampling that one might expect in a large scale brain survey with thousands of neurons.  Using these results, we compare the representations measured in the Allen Brain Observatory in response to natural image presentations.  We show that the visual cortical areas are relatively high order representations (in that they map to deeper layers of convolutional neural networks).  Furthermore, we see evidence of a broad, more parallel organization rather than a sequential hierarchy, with the primary area VisP (V1) being lower order relative to the other areas.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/748d6b6ed8e13f857ceaa6cfbdca14b8-Paper.pdf,2019,"representations, networks, brain, cortical, metrics, allen, areas, compare, comparison, cortex","similarity, neurons, visual, areas, layers, depth, pseudo, vgg16, representations, brain","{'artificial': 0.3480199422547918, 'mouse': 0.3480199422547918, 'cortex': 0.32937971202440836, 'properties': 0.32937971202440836, 'reveals': 0.32937971202440836, 'driven': 0.31615425820256055, 'comparison': 0.2975140279721771, 'functional': 0.27403011519111187, 'task': 0.252422890098098, 'visual': 0.2470081136895623}","{'cortical': 0.28170601630235653, 'representations': 0.28076632508690497, 'observatory': 0.20673307197939564, 'allen': 0.19566028105550912, 'brain': 0.19285443210956665, 'metrics': 0.19170046019722314, 'stimuli': 0.16887494975707978, 'cortex': 0.16565842902046463, 'networks': 0.1591481609852279, 'areas': 0.14829029917893866}"
Interpreting and improving natural-language processing (in machines) with  natural language-processing (in the brain),"Mariya Toneva, Leila Wehbe","Neural networks models for NLP are typically implemented without the explicit encoding of language rules and yet they are able to break one performance record after another.  This has generated a lot of research interest in interpreting the representations learned by these networks. We propose here a novel interpretation approach that relies on the only processing system we have that does understand language: the human brain. We use brain imaging recordings of subjects reading complex natural text to interpret word and sequence embeddings from 4 recent NLP models - ELMo, USE, BERT and Transformer-XL. We study how their representations differ across layer depth, context length, and attention type. Our results reveal differences in the context-related representations across these models. Further, in the transformer models, we find an interaction between layer depth and context length, and between layer depth and attention type. We finally hypothesize that altering BERT to better align with brain recordings would enable it to also better understand language. Probing the altered BERT using syntactic NLP tasks reveals that the model with increased brain-alignment outperforms the original model. Cognitive neuroscientists have already begun using NLP networks to study the brain, and this work closes the loop to allow the interaction between NLP and cognitive neuroscience to be a true cross-pollination.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/749a8e6c231831ef7756db230b4359c8-Paper.pdf,2019,"brain, nlp, models, bert, context, depth, language, layer, networks, representations","brain, layer, word, al, et, representations, context, layers, model, use","{'processing': 0.5545972153111626, 'natural': 0.4730168499779303, 'language': 0.43330117642674476, 'interpreting': 0.30524796968509715, 'machines': 0.26830092278410206, 'improving': 0.24459995024288822, 'brain': 0.23650842498896515}","{'nlp': 0.38316474449031496, 'brain': 0.32074061454284875, 'bert': 0.23619993983043294, 'depth': 0.19017288469407173, 'recordings': 0.17635543909611814, 'cognitive': 0.16530619207560643, 'context': 0.16353133601631364, 'language': 0.1618396658803275, 'layer': 0.1533866972667715, 'interaction': 0.14354622159514718}"

Guided Similarity Separation for Image Retrieval,"Chundi Liu, Guangwei Yu, Maksims Volkovs, Cheng Chang, Himanshu Rai, Junwei Ma, Satya Krishna Gorti","Despite recent progress in computer vision, image retrieval remains a challenging open problem. Numerous variations such as view angle, lighting and occlusion make it difficult to design models that are both robust and efficient. Many leading methods traverse the nearest neighbor graph to exploit higher order neighbor information and uncover the highly complex underlying manifold. In this work we propose a different approach where we leverage graph convolutional networks to directly encode neighbor information into image descriptors. We further leverage ideas from clustering and manifold learning, and introduce an unsupervised loss based on pairwise separation of image similarities. Empirically, we demonstrate that our model is able to successfully learn a new descriptor space that significantly improves retrieval accuracy, while still allowing efficient inner product inference.

Rethinking Deep Neural Network Ownership Verification: Embedding Passports to Defeat Ambiguity Attacks,"Lixin Fan, Kam Woh Ng, Chee Seng Chan","With substantial amount of time, resources and human (team) efforts invested to explore and develop successful deep neural networks (DNN), there emerges an urgent need to protect these inventions from being illegally copied, redistributed, or abused without respecting the intellectual properties of legitimate owners. Following recent progresses along this line, we investigate a number of watermark-based DNN ownership verification methods in the face of ambiguity attacks, which aim to cast doubts on the ownership verification by forging counterfeit watermarks. It is shown that ambiguity attacks pose serious threats to existing DNN watermarking methods. As remedies to the above-mentioned loophole, this paper proposes novel passport-based DNN ownership verification schemes which are both robust to network modifications and resilient to ambiguity attacks. The gist of embedding digital passports is to design and train DNN models in a way such that, the DNN inference performance of an original task will be significantly deteriorated due to forged passports. In other words, genuine passports are not only verified by looking for the predefined signatures, but also reasserted by the unyielding DNN model inference performances. Extensive experimental results justify the effectiveness of the proposed passport-based DNN ownership verification schemes.

We run experiments on a transformer model, an LSTM, and a residual network, demonstrating up to a 40x reduction in total communication cost with no loss in final model performance.

The proposed approach inherits the flexibility of HMC while enabling tractable entropy estimation for the augmented model. By learning both a dual sampler and the primal model simultaneously, and sharing parameters between them, we obviate the requirement to design a separate sampling procedure once the model has been trained, leading to more effective learning. We show that many existing estimators, such as contrastive divergence, pseudo/composite-likelihood, score matching, minimum Stein discrepancy estimator, non-local contrastive objectives, noise-contrastive estimation, and minimum probability flow, are special cases of the proposed approach, each expressed by a different (fixed) dual sampler.

Group Retention when Using Machine Learning in Sequential Decision Making: the Interplay between User Dynamics and Fairness,"Xueru Zhang, Mohammadmahdi Khaliligarekani, Cem Tekin, mingyan liu","Machine Learning (ML) models trained on data from multiple demographic groups can inherit representation disparity (Hashimoto et al., 2018) that may exist in the data: the model may be less favorable to groups contributing less to the training process; this in turn can degrade population retention in these groups over time, and exacerbate representation disparity in the long run. In this study, we seek to understand the interplay between ML decisions and the underlying group representation, how they evolve in a sequential framework, and how the use of fairness criteria plays a role in this process. We show that the representation disparity can easily worsen over time under a natural user dynamics (arrival and departure) model when decisions are made based on a commonly used objective and fairness criteria, resulting in some groups diminishing entirely from the sample pool in the long run. It highlights the fact that fairness criteria have to be defined while taking into consideration the impact of decisions on user dynamics.

Shallow RNN:  Accurate Time-series Classification on Resource Constrained Devices,"Don Dennis, Durmus Alp Emre Acar, Vikram Mandikal, Vinu Sankar Sadasivan, Venkatesh Saligrama, Harsha Vardhan Simhadri, Prateek Jain","Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) capture long dependencies and context, and
2 hence are the key component of typical sequential data based tasks. However, the
sequential nature of RNNs dictates a large inference cost for long sequences even if
the hardware supports parallelization. To induce long-term dependencies, and yet
admit parallelization, we introduce novel shallow RNNs. In this architecture, the
first layer splits the input sequence and runs several independent RNNs. The second
layer consumes the output of the first layer using a second RNN thus capturing
long dependencies. We provide theoretical justification for our architecture under
weak assumptions that we verify on real-world benchmarks. Furthermore, we show
that for time-series classification, our technique leads to substantially improved
inference time over standard RNNs without compromising accuracy. For example,
we can deploy audio-keyword classification on tiny Cortex M4 devices (100MHz
processor, 256KB RAM, no DSP available) which was not possible using standard

Towards Understanding the Importance of Shortcut Connections in Residual Networks,"Tianyi Liu, Minshuo Chen, Mo Zhou, Simon S. Du, Enlu Zhou, Tuo Zhao","Residual Network (ResNet) is undoubtedly a milestone in deep learning.

While initially inspired by brain anatomy, over the past years, these ANNs have evolved from a simple eight-layer architecture in AlexNet to extremely deep and branching architectures, demonstrating increasingly better object categorization performance, yet bringing into question how brain-like they still are. In particular, typical deep models from the machine learning community are often hard to map onto the brain's anatomy due to their vast number of layers and missing biologically-important connections, such as recurrence. Here we demonstrate that better anatomical alignment to the brain and high performance on machine learning as well as neuroscience measures do not have to be in contradiction. We developed CORnet-S, a shallow ANN with four anatomically mapped areas and recurrent connectivity, guided by Brain-Score, a new large-scale composite of neural and behavioral benchmarks for quantifying the functional fidelity of models of the primate ventral visual stream. Despite being significantly shallower than most models, CORnet-S is the top model on Brain-Score and outperforms similarly compact models on ImageNet. Moreover, our extensive analyses of CORnet-S circuitry variants reveal that recurrence is the main predictive factor of both Brain-Score and ImageNet top-1 performance. Finally, we report that the temporal evolution of the CORnet-S ""IT"" neural population resembles the actual monkey IT population dynamics.

Defending Neural Backdoors via Generative Distribution Modeling,"Ximing Qiao, Yukun Yang, Hai Li","Neural backdoor attack is emerging as a severe security threat to deep learning, while the capability of existing defense methods is limited, especially for complex backdoor triggers. In the work, we explore the space formed by the pixel values of all possible backdoor triggers. An original trigger used by an attacker to build the backdoored model represents only a point in the space. It then will be generalized into a distribution of valid triggers, all of which can influence the backdoored model. Thus, previous methods that model only one point of the trigger distribution is not sufficient. Getting the entire trigger distribution, e.g., via generative modeling, is a key of effective defense. However, existing generative modeling techniques for image generation are not applicable to the backdoor scenario as the trigger distribution is completely unknown. In this work, we propose max-entropy staircase approximator (MESA) for high-dimensional sampling-free generative modeling and use it to recover the trigger distribution. We also develop a defense technique to remove the triggers from the backdoored model.

Transfer Anomaly Detection by Inferring Latent Domain Representations,"Atsutoshi Kumagai, Tomoharu Iwata, Yasuhiro Fujiwara","We propose a method to improve the anomaly detection performance on target
domains by transferring knowledge on related domains. Although anomaly labels
are valuable to learn anomaly detectors, they are difficult to obtain due to their rarity.
To alleviate this problem, existing methods use anomalous and normal instances
in the related domains as well as target normal instances. These methods require
training on each target domain. However, this requirement can be problematic
in some situations due to the high computational cost of training. The proposed
method can infer the anomaly detectors for target domains without re-training by
introducing the concept of latent domain vectors, which are latent representations
of the domains and are used for inferring the anomaly detectors. The latent
domain vector for each domain is inferred from the set of normal instances in the
domain. The anomaly score function for each domain is modeled on the basis of
autoencoders, and its domain-specific property is controlled by the latent domain
vector. The anomaly score function for each domain is trained so that the scores of
normal instances become low and the scores of anomalies become higher than those
of the normal instances, while considering the uncertainty of the latent domain
vectors. When target normal instances can be used during training, the proposed
method can also use them for training in a unified framework. The effectiveness

Uncertainty on Asynchronous Time Event Prediction,"Marin Biloš, Bertrand Charpentier, Stephan Günnemann","Asynchronous event sequences are the basis of many applications throughout different industries. In this work, we tackle the task of predicting the next event (given a history), and how this prediction changes with the passage of time.

We present two new architectures, WGP-LN and FD-Dir, modelling the evolution of the distribution on the probability simplex with time-dependent logistic normal and Dirichlet distributions.

Breaking the Glass Ceiling for Embedding-Based Classifiers for Large Output Spaces,"Chuan Guo, Ali Mousavi, Xiang Wu, Daniel N.

Most prior works attribute this poor performance to the low-dimensional bottleneck in embedding-based methods. In this paper, we demonstrate that theoretically there is no limitation to using low-dimensional embedding-based methods, and provide experimental evidence that overfitting is the root cause of the poor performance of embedding-based methods. These findings motivate us to investigate novel data augmentation and regularization techniques to mitigate overfitting. To this end, we propose GLaS, a new regularizer for embedding-based neural network approaches. It is a natural generalization from the graph Laplacian and spread-out regularizers, and empirically it addresses the drawback of each regularizer alone when applied to the extreme classification setup.

Faster width-dependent algorithm for mixed packing and covering LPs,"Digvijay Boob, Saurabh Sawlani, Di Wang","In this paper, we give a faster width-dependent algorithm for mixed packing-covering LPs. Mixed packing-covering LPs are fundamental to combinatorial optimization in computer science and operations research. Our algorithm finds a $1+\eps$ approximate solution in time $O(Nw/ \varepsilon)$, where $N$ is number of nonzero entries in the constraint matrix, and $w$ is the maximum number of nonzeros in any constraint. This algorithm is faster than Nesterov's smoothing algorithm which requires $O(N\sqrt{n}w/ \eps)$ time, where $n$ is the dimension of the problem. Our work utilizes the framework of area convexity introduced in [Sherman-FOCS'17] to obtain the best dependence on $\varepsilon$ while breaking the infamous $\ell_{\infty}$ barrier to eliminate the factor of $\sqrt{n}$. The current best width-independent algorithm for this problem runs in time $O(N/\eps^2)$ [Young-arXiv-14] and hence has worse running time dependence on $\varepsilon$. Many real life instances of mixed packing-covering problems exhibit small width and for such cases, our algorithm can report higher precision results when compared to width-independent algorithms. As a special case of our result, we report a $1+\varepsilon$ approximation algorithm for the densest subgraph problem which runs in time $O(md/ \varepsilon)$, where $m$ is the number of edges in the graph and $d$ is the maximum graph degree.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/791d3a0048b9c200dceca07f99ddd178-Paper.pdf,2019,"algorithm, time, varepsilon, width, covering, eps, mixed, number, packing, problem","area, convex, function, algorithm, problem, width, covering, matrix, mpc, packing","{'lps': 0.39106795763034136, 'packing': 0.39106795763034136, 'width': 0.39106795763034136, 'covering': 0.37012204079946454, 'faster': 0.34373330643855654, 'mixed': 0.34373330643855654, 'dependent': 0.3194533949701566, 'algorithm': 0.2566156444775263}","{'varepsilon': 0.37014581650869566, 'width': 0.27639645350485237, 'packing': 0.26802414517522855, 'covering': 0.241009570780184, 'eps': 0.23231282031099437, 'mixed': 0.2072973401286393, 'algorithm': 0.20259795011714524, 'lps': 0.17868276345015238, 'time': 0.16476053017691786, 'report': 0.15487521354066291}"

Rather than directly selecting micro-actions, our agent first generates a latent plan in natural language, which is then executed by a separate model. We introduce a challenging real-time strategy game environment in which the actions of a large number of units must be coordinated across long time scales. We gather a dataset of 76 thousand pairs of instructions and executions from human play, and train instructor and executor models.

Structured Prediction with Projection Oracles,Mathieu Blondel,"We propose in this paper a general framework for deriving loss functions for structured prediction.  In our framework, the user chooses a convex set including the output space and provides an oracle for projecting onto that set.  Given that oracle, our framework automatically generates a corresponding convex and smooth loss function.  As we show, adding a projection as output layer provably makes the loss smaller.  We identify the marginal polytope, the output space's convex hull, as the best convex set on which to project.  However, because the projection onto the marginal polytope can sometimes be expensive to compute, we allow to use any convex superset instead, with potentially cheaper-to-compute projection.  Since efficient projection algorithms are available for numerous convex sets, this allows us to construct loss functions for a variety of tasks.  On the theoretical side, when combined with calibrated decoding, we prove that our loss functions can be used as a consistent surrogate for a (potentially non-convex) target loss function of interest.  We demonstrate our losses on label ranking, ordinal regression and multilabel classification, confirming the improved accuracy enabled by projections.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/7990ec44fcf3d7a0e5a2add28362213c-Paper.pdf,2019,"convex, loss, projection, framework, functions, output, set, compute, function, marginal","polytope, projection, loss, set, convex, using, projections, map, euclidean, marginal","{'oracles': 0.6008825853927182, 'projection': 0.5458640870430059, 'structured': 0.4358270903435812, 'prediction': 0.3886222643790703}","{'convex': 0.3782783002958294, 'projection': 0.33220269058479673, 'loss': 0.3131556980474432, 'polytope': 0.21887852307241498, 'onto': 0.1813649354297298, 'output': 0.1812933869382165, 'marginal': 0.1692867469627886, 'potentially': 0.16320594520897802, 'oracle': 0.16185138104007882, 'functions': 0.15131946448293673}"
Sobolev Independence Criterion,"Youssef Mroueh, Tom Sercu, Mattia Rigotti, Inkit Padhi, Cicero Nogueira dos Santos","We propose the Sobolev Independence Criterion (SIC), an interpretable dependency measure between a high dimensional random variable X and a response variable Y. SIC decomposes to the sum of feature importance scores and hence can be used for nonlinear feature selection. SIC can be seen as a gradient regularized Integral Probability Metric (IPM) between the joint distribution of the two random variables and the product of their marginals. We use sparsity inducing gradient penalties to promote input sparsity of the critic of the IPM. In the kernel version we show that SIC can be cast as a convex optimization problem by introducing auxiliary variables that play an important role in feature selection as they are normalized feature importance scores. We then present a neural version of SIC where the critic is parameterized as a homogeneous neural network, improving its representation power as well as its interpretability. We conduct experiments validating SIC for feature selection in synthetic and real-world experiments. We show that SIC enables reliable and interpretable discoveries, when used in conjunction with the holdout randomization test and knockoffs to control the False Discovery Rate.

Embedding Symbolic Knowledge into Deep Networks,"Yaqi Xie, Ziwei Xu, Mohan S.

Partitioning Structure Learning for Segmented Linear Regression Trees,"Xiangyu Zheng, Song Xi Chen","This paper proposes a partitioning structure learning method for segmented linear regression trees (SLRT), which assigns linear predictors over the terminal nodes. The recursive partitioning process is driven by an adaptive split selection algorithm that maximizes, at each node, a criterion function based on a conditional Kendall’s τ statistic that measures the rank dependence between the regressors and the fit- ted linear residuals. Theoretical analysis shows that the split selection algorithm permits consistent identification and estimation of the unknown segments. A suffi- ciently large tree is induced by applying the split selection algorithm recursively. Then the minimal cost-complexity tree pruning procedure is applied to attain the right-sized tree, that ensures (i) the nested structure of pruned subtrees and (ii) consistent estimation to the number of segments. Implanting the SLRT as the built-in base predictor, we obtain the ensemble predictors by random forests (RF) and the proposed weighted random forests (WRF). The practical performance of the SLRT and its ensemble versions are evaluated via numerical simulations and empirical studies. The latter shows their advantageous predictive performance over a set of state-of-the-art tree-based models on well-studied public datasets.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/7bb060764a818184ebb1cc0d43d382aa-Paper.pdf,2019,"tree, algorithm, linear, selection, slrt, split, based, consistent, ensemble, estimation","split, tree, linear, regression, algorithm, partitioning, 10, xj, node, slrt","{'segmented': 0.49958942553895347, 'partitioning': 0.47283101091369817, 'trees': 0.43911939536751254, 'structure': 0.338408270060248, 'regression': 0.3187094131406478, 'linear': 0.3052730282269538, 'learning': 0.1572511640261477}","{'slrt': 0.33344860109236923, 'split': 0.2723856188895346, 'tree': 0.26174083767054135, 'forests': 0.1900382217370141, 'segments': 0.1900382217370141, 'selection': 0.18589326263076988, 'predictors': 0.18159041259302308, 'partitioning': 0.1631312644931694, 'ensemble': 0.15945583788585194, 'linear': 0.1297295061390952}"
Sparse Variational Inference: Bayesian Coresets from Scratch,"Trevor Campbell, Boyan Beronov","The proliferation of automated inference algorithms in Bayesian statistics has provided practitioners newfound access to fast, reproducible data analysis and powerful statistical models.  Designing automated methods that are also both computationally scalable and theoretically sound, however, remains a significant challenge.  Recent work on Bayesian coresets takes the approach of compressing the dataset before running a standard inference algorithm, providing both scalability and guarantees on posterior approximation error.  But the automation of past coreset methods is limited because they depend on the availability of a reasonable coarse posterior approximation, which is difficult to specify in practice.  In the present work we remove this requirement by formulating coreset construction as sparsity-constrained variational inference within an exponential family.  This perspective leads to a novel construction via greedy optimization, and also provides a unifying information-geometric view of present and past methods.  The proposed Riemannian coreset construction algorithm is fully automated, requiring no problem-specific inputs aside from the probabilistic model and dataset.  In addition to being significantly easier to use than past methods, experiments demonstrate that past coreset constructions are fundamentally limited by the fixed coarse posterior approximation; in contrast, the proposed algorithm is able to continually improve the coreset, providing state-of-the-art Bayesian dataset summarization with orders-of-magnitude reduction in KL divergence to the exact posterior.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/7bec7e63a493e2d61891b1e4051ef75a-Paper.pdf,2019,"coreset, methods, past, posterior, algorithm, approximation, automated, bayesian, construction, dataset","coreset, πw, construction, posterior, inference, greedy, log, rn, data, sparse","{'scratch': 0.5219535798190263, 'coresets': 0.5009957833457174, 'sparse': 0.3542089952150169, 'inference': 0.3495073286177135, 'variational': 0.34509079172866863, 'bayesian': 0.33145232839621563}","{'coreset': 0.46201417977874554, 'past': 0.25843284178157133, 'automated': 0.2443604998033523, 'posterior': 0.24060701309065813, 'construction': 0.22384338325782693, 'coarse': 0.15620894737192037, 'bayesian': 0.15282168710055308, 'approximation': 0.14768158024667916, 'dataset': 0.14147259273236484, 'inference': 0.1372115424466256}"
Policy Evaluation with Latent Confounders via Optimal Balance,"Andrew Bennett, Nathan Kallus","Evaluating novel contextual bandit policies using logged data is crucial in applications where exploration is costly, such as medicine. But it usually relies on the assumption of no unobserved confounders, which is bound to fail in practice. We study the question of policy evaluation when we instead have proxies for the latent confounders and develop an importance weighting method that avoids fitting a latent outcome regression model. Surprisingly, we show that there exist no single set of weights that give unbiased evaluation regardless of outcome model, unlike the case with no unobserved confounders where density ratios are sufficient. Instead, we propose an adversarial objective and weights that minimize it, ensuring sufficient balance in the latent confounders regardless of outcome model.

Dancing to Music,"Hsin-Ying Lee, Xiaodong Yang, Ming-Yu Liu, Ting-Chun Wang, Yu-Ding Lu, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Jan Kautz","Dancing to music is an instinctive move by humans. Learning to model the music-to-dance generation process is, however, a challenging problem. It requires significant efforts to measure the correlation between music and dance as one needs to simultaneously consider multiple aspects, such as style and beat of both music and dance. Additionally, dance is inherently multimodal and various following movements of a pose at any moment are equally likely. In this paper, we propose a synthesis-by-analysis learning framework to generate dance from music. In the top-down analysis phase, we decompose a dance into a series of basic dance units, through which the model learns how to move. In the bottom-up synthesis phase, the model learns how to compose a dance by combining multiple basic dancing movements seamlessly according to input music.

Stochastic Runge-Kutta Accelerates Langevin Monte Carlo and Beyond,"Xuechen Li, Yi Wu, Lester Mackey, Murat A.

In this paper, we establish the convergence rate of sampling algorithms obtained by discretizing smooth It\^o diffusions exhibiting fast $2$-Wasserstein contraction, based on local deviation properties of the integration scheme. In particular, we study a sampling algorithm constructed by discretizing the overdamped Langevin diffusion with the method of stochastic Runge-Kutta. For strongly convex potentials that are smooth up to a certain order, its iterates 
converge to the target distribution in $2$-Wasserstein distance in $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\epsilon^{-2/3})$ iterations. This improves upon the best-known rate for strongly log-concave sampling based on the overdamped Langevin equation using only the gradient oracle without adjustment. Additionally, we extend our analysis of stochastic Runge-Kutta methods to uniformly dissipative diffusions with possibly non-convex potentials and
show they achieve better rates compared to the Euler-Maruyama scheme on the dependence on tolerance $\epsilon$.

Reverse KL-Divergence Training of Prior Networks: Improved Uncertainty and Adversarial Robustness,"Andrey Malinin, Mark Gales","Ensemble approaches for uncertainty estimation have recently been applied to the tasks of misclassification detection, out-of-distribution input detection and adversarial attack detection. Prior Networks have been proposed as an approach to efficiently emulate an ensemble of models for classification by parameterising a Dirichlet prior distribution over output distributions. These models have been shown to outperform alternative ensemble approaches, such as Monte-Carlo Dropout, on the task of out-of-distribution input detection. However, scaling Prior Networks to complex datasets with many classes is difficult using the training criteria originally proposed. This paper makes two contributions. First, we show that the appropriate training criterion for Prior Networks is the reverse KL-divergence between Dirichlet distributions. This addresses issues in the nature of the training data target distributions, enabling prior networks to be successfully trained on classification tasks with arbitrarily many classes, as well as improving out-of-distribution detection performance. Second, taking advantage of this new training criterion, this paper investigates using Prior Networks to detect adversarial attacks and proposes a generalized form of adversarial training. It is shown that the construction of successful adaptive whitebox attacks, which affect the prediction and evade detection, against Prior Networks trained on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using the proposed approach requires a greater amount of computational effort than against networks defended using standard adversarial training or MC-dropout.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/7dd2ae7db7d18ee7c9425e38df1af5e2-Paper.pdf,2019,"networks, prior, detection, training, adversarial, distribution, using, distributions, ensemble, proposed","prior, networks, uncertainty, distribution, adversarial, kl, training, using, attacks, divergence","{'kl': 0.41450781531245817, 'reverse': 0.3923064407025493, 'divergence': 0.3765543147332954, 'prior': 0.3386008141541327, 'improved': 0.3263825160183764, 'uncertainty': 0.29732779257891995, 'robustness': 0.27406317432683336, 'training': 0.2504755148600509, 'adversarial': 0.232051867493904, 'networks': 0.1766613287107049}","{'detection': 0.35441566470968194, 'prior': 0.3379409142742582, 'networks': 0.22933483599918683, 'ensemble': 0.22895196188754718, 'training': 0.20356512300255344, 'adversarial': 0.18714099941766918, 'dirichlet': 0.17051159128387616, 'dropout': 0.16487095707446583, 'distribution': 0.16421198268427528, 'criterion': 0.14950821006261278}"
Adversarial Fisher Vectors for Unsupervised Representation Learning,"Shuangfei Zhai, Walter Talbott, Carlos Guestrin, Joshua Susskind","We examine Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) through the lens of deep Energy Based Models (EBMs), with the goal of exploiting the density model that follows from this formulation. In contrast to a traditional view where the discriminator learns a constant function when reaching convergence, here we show that it can provide useful information for downstream tasks, e.g., feature extraction for classification. To be concrete, in the EBM formulation,  the discriminator learns an unnormalized density function (i.e., the negative energy term) that characterizes the data manifold. We propose to evaluate both the generator and the discriminator by deriving corresponding Fisher Score and Fisher Information from the EBM. We show that by assuming that the generated examples form an estimate of the learned density, both the Fisher Information and the normalized Fisher Vectors are easy to compute.

Don't Blame the ELBO! A Linear VAE Perspective on Posterior Collapse,"James Lucas, George Tucker, Roger B. Grosse, Mohammad Norouzi","Posterior collapse in Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with uninformative priors arises when the variational posterior distribution closely matches the prior for a subset of latent variables. This paper presents a simple and intuitive explanation for posterior collapse through the analysis of linear VAEs and their direct correspondence with Probabilistic PCA (pPCA). We explain how posterior collapse may occur in pPCA due to local maxima in the log marginal likelihood. Unexpectedly, we prove that the ELBO objective for the linear VAE does not introduce additional spurious local maxima relative to log marginal likelihood. We show further that training a linear VAE with exact variational inference recovers a uniquely identifiable global maximum corresponding to the principal component directions. Empirically, we find that our linear analysis is predictive even for high-capacity, non-linear VAEs and helps explain the relationship between the observation noise, local maxima, and posterior collapse in deep Gaussian VAEs.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/7e3315fe390974fcf25e44a9445bd821-Paper.pdf,2019,"linear, posterior, collapse, vaes, local, maxima, variational, analysis, explain, likelihood","collapse, linear, posterior, elbo, σ2, vaes, likelihood, vae, ppca, variational","{'collapse': 0.42767535107892457, 'elbo': 0.42767535107892457, 'blame': 0.40476871257906866, 'posterior': 0.388516193916515, 'vae': 0.3759097610538257, 'perspective': 0.3313660817945073, 'linear': 0.2613300899654635}","{'collapse': 0.37242635952844816, 'vaes': 0.35761079787554795, 'posterior': 0.3191901116405152, 'maxima': 0.31678238303906703, 'ppca': 0.22313980415895954, 'linear': 0.2170335735304026, 'variational': 0.1716087811650473, 'vae': 0.16578187214220155, 'local': 0.15793238369837076, 'marginal': 0.15678039799776294}"
Kernel-Based Approaches for Sequence Modeling: Connections to Neural Methods,"Kevin Liang, Guoyin Wang, Yitong Li, Ricardo Henao, Lawrence Carin","We investigate time-dependent data analysis from the perspective of recurrent kernel machines, from which models with hidden units and gated memory cells arise naturally. By considering dynamic gating of the memory cell, a model closely related to the long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network is derived. Extending this setup to $n$-gram filters, the convolutional neural network (CNN), Gated CNN, and recurrent additive network (RAN) are also recovered as special cases. Our analysis provides a new perspective on the LSTM, while also extending it to $n$-gram convolutional filters.

Efficient Symmetric Norm Regression via Linear Sketching,"Zhao Song, Ruosong Wang, Lin Yang, Hongyang Zhang, Peilin Zhong","We provide efficient algorithms for overconstrained linear regression problems with size $n \times d$ when the loss function is a symmetric norm (a norm invariant under sign-flips and coordinate-permutations). An important class of symmetric norms are Orlicz norms, where for a function  $G$ and a vector $y \in \mathbb{R}^n$, the corresponding Orlicz norm $\|y\|_G$ is defined as the unique value $\alpha$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^n G(|y_i|/\alpha) = 1$. When the loss function is an Orlicz norm, our algorithm produces a $(1 + \varepsilon)$-approximate solution for an arbitrarily small constant $\varepsilon > 0$ in input-sparsity time, improving over the previously best-known algorithm which produces a $d \cdot \polylog n$-approximate solution. When the loss function is a general symmetric norm, our algorithm produces a $\sqrt{d} \cdot \polylog n \cdot \mathrm{mmc}(\ell)$-approximate solution in input-sparsity time, where $\mathrm{mmc}(\ell)$ is a quantity related to the symmetric norm under consideration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first input-sparsity time algorithm with provable guarantees for the general class of symmetric norm regression problem.

As a result, two very different examples could share the same feature activation and therefore the same classification decision.

Characterizing Bias in Classifiers using Generative Models,"Daniel McDuff, Shuang Ma, Yale Song, Ashish Kapoor","Models that are learned from real-world data are often biased because the data used to train them is biased.

We propose a simulation-based approach for interrogating classifiers using generative adversarial models in a systematic manner.

List-decodable Linear Regression,"Sushrut Karmalkar, Adam Klivans, Pravesh Kothari","We give the first polynomial-time algorithm for robust regression in the list-decodable setting where an adversary can corrupt a greater than 1/2 fraction of examples.For any \alpha < 1, our algorithm takes as input a sample {(xi,yi)}{i \leq n} of n linear equations where \alpha n of the equations satisfy yi = \langle x_i,\ell^\rangle +\zeta for some small noise \zeta and (1-\alpha) n of the equations are {\em arbitrarily} chosen. It outputs a list L of size O(1/\alpha) - a fixed constant - that contains an \ell that is close to \ell^.Our algorithm succeeds whenever the inliers are chosen from a certifiably anti-concentrated distribution D. In particular, this gives a (d/\alpha)^{O(1/\alpha^8)} time algorithm to find a O(1/\alpha) size list when the inlier distribution is a standard Gaussian. For discrete product distributions that are anti-concentrated only in regular directions, we give an algorithm that achieves similar guarantee under the promise that \ell^* has all coordinates of the same magnitude.

Infra-slow brain dynamics as a marker for cognitive function and decline,"Shagun Ajmera, Shreya Rajagopal, Razi Rehman, Devarajan Sridharan","Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables measuring human brain activity, in vivo. Yet, the fMRI hemodynamic response unfolds over very slow timescales (<0.1-1 Hz), orders of magnitude slower than millisecond timescales of neural spiking. It is unclear, therefore, if slow dynamics as measured with fMRI are relevant for cognitive function. We investigated this question with a novel application of Gaussian Process Factor Analysis (GPFA) and machine learning to fMRI data. We analyzed slowly sampled (1.4 Hz) fMRI data from 1000 healthy human participants (Human Connectome Project database), and applied GPFA to reduce dimensionality and extract smooth latent dynamics. GPFA dimensions with slow (<1 Hz) characteristic timescales identified, with high accuracy (>95%), the specific task that each subject was performing inside the fMRI scanner. Moreover, functional connectivity between slow GPFA latents accurately predicted inter-individual differences in behavioral scores across a range of cognitive tasks. Finally, infra-slow (<0.1 Hz) latent dynamics predicted CDR (Clinical Dementia Rating) scores of individual patients, and identified patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who would progress to develop Alzheimer’s dementia (AD).

Maximum Entropy Monte-Carlo Planning,"Chenjun Xiao, Ruitong Huang, Jincheng Mei, Dale Schuurmans, Martin Müller","We develop a new algorithm for online planning in large scale sequential decision problems that improves upon the worst case efficiency of UCT.  The idea is to augment Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with maximum entropy policy optimization, evaluating each search node by softmax values back-propagated from simulation.  To establish the effectiveness of this approach, we first investigate the single-step decision problem, stochastic softmax bandits, and show that softmax values can be estimated at an optimal convergence rate in terms of mean squared error.

Learnable Tree Filter for Structure-preserving Feature Transform,"Lin Song, Yanwei Li, Zeming Li, Gang Yu, Hongbin Sun, Jian Sun, Nanning Zheng","Learning discriminative global features plays a vital role in semantic segmentation. And most of the existing methods adopt stacks of local convolutions or non-local blocks to capture long-range context. However, due to the absence of spatial structure preservation, these operators ignore the object details when enlarging receptive fields. In this paper, we propose the learnable tree filter to form a generic tree filtering module that leverages the structural property of minimal spanning tree to model long-range dependencies while preserving the details. Furthermore, we propose a highly efficient linear-time algorithm to reduce resource consumption. Thus, the designed modules can be plugged into existing deep neural networks conveniently. To this end, tree filtering modules are embedded to formulate a unified framework for semantic segmentation. We conduct extensive ablation studies to elaborate on the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Specifically, it attains better performance with much less overhead compared with the classic PSP block and Non-local operation under the same backbone.

The Implicit Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm,"Kirill Neklyudov, Evgenii Egorov, Dmitry P.

For any implicit probabilistic model and a target distribution represented by a set of samples, implicit Metropolis-Hastings operates by learning a discriminator to estimate the density-ratio and then generating a chain of samples. Since the approximation of density ratio introduces an error on every step of the chain, it is crucial to analyze the stationary distribution of such chain. For that purpose, we present a theoretical result stating that the discriminator loss upper bounds the total variation distance between the target distribution and the stationary distribution.

Optimal Analysis of Subset-Selection Based L_p Low-Rank Approximation,"Chen Dan, Hong Wang, Hongyang Zhang, Yuchen Zhou, Pradeep K.

This improves upon the previous $O(k+1)$ bound (Chierichetti et al.,2017) for $p\ge 1$. We complement our analysis with lower bounds; these bounds match our upper bounds up to constant 1 when $p\geq 2$. At the core of our techniques is an application of Riesz-Thorin interpolation theorem from harmonic analysis, which might be of independent interest to other algorithmic designs and analysis more broadly.

Our analysis results in improvements on approximation guarantees of several other algorithms with various time complexity. For example, to make the algorithm of column subset selection computationally efficient, we analyze a polynomial time bi-criteria algorithm which selects $O(k\log m)$ number of columns. We show that this algorithm has an approximation ratio of $O((k+1)^{1/p})$ for $1\le p\le 2$ and $O((k+1)^{1-1/p})$ for $p\ge 2$. This improves over the bound in (Chierichetti et al.,2017) with an $O(k+1)$ approximation ratio.

Communication-Efficient Distributed Blockwise Momentum SGD with Error-Feedback,"Shuai Zheng, Ziyue Huang, James Kwok","Communication overhead is a major bottleneck hampering the scalability of distributed machine learning systems. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in 
using gradient compression to improve the communication efficiency of distributed neural network training. Using 1-bit quantization, signSGD with majority vote achieves a 32x reduction in communication cost. However, its convergence is based on unrealistic assumptions and can diverge in practice. In this paper, we propose a general distributed compressed SGD with Nesterov's momentum. We consider two-way compression, which compresses the gradients both to and from workers. Convergence analysis on nonconvex problems for general gradient compressors is provided. By partitioning the gradient into blocks, a blockwise compressor is introduced such that each gradient block is compressed and transmitted in 1-bit format with a scaling factor, leading to a nearly 32x reduction on communication. Experimental results show that the proposed method converges as fast as full-precision distributed momentum SGD and achieves the same testing accuracy. In particular, on distributed ResNet training with 7 workers on the ImageNet, the proposed algorithm achieves the same testing accuracy as momentum SGD using full-precision gradients, but with $46\%$ less wall clock time.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/80c0e8c4457441901351e4abbcf8c75c-Paper.pdf,2019,"distributed, communication, gradient, achieves, momentum, sgd, using, 32x, accuracy, bit","sgd, gradient, ef, xt, distributed, pt, dist, et, momentum, error","{'blockwise': 0.45987047667972974, 'momentum': 0.38376812270220656, 'error': 0.3510253744545703, 'feedback': 0.34166108935267303, 'sgd': 0.34166108935267303, 'communication': 0.3374699374269964, 'distributed': 0.326394338928478, 'efficient': 0.2532558707279292}","{'distributed': 0.32255171593573834, 'communication': 0.28086514835774296, 'momentum': 0.25800754296941797, '32x': 0.2285051870013233, 'sgd': 0.20944139377912438, 'workers': 0.18666003269146314, 'compressed': 0.17200502864627865, 'bit': 0.16976808704330035, 'gradient': 0.16625487499540983, 'achieves': 0.1503971852623344}"
Coresets for Clustering with Fairness Constraints,"Lingxiao Huang, Shaofeng Jiang, Nisheeth Vishnoi","In a recent work, \cite{chierichetti2017fair} studied the following ``fair'' variants of classical clustering problems such as k-means and k-median: given a set of n data points in R^d and a binary type associated to each data point, the goal is to cluster the points while ensuring that the proportion of each type in each cluster is roughly the same as its underlying proportion. Subsequent work has focused on either extending this setting to when each data point has multiple, non-disjoint sensitive types such as race and gender \cite{bera2019fair}, or to address the problem that the clustering algorithms in the above work do not scale well. The main contribution of this paper is an approach to clustering with fairness constraints that involve {\em multiple, non-disjoint} attributes, that is {\em also scalable}. Our approach is based on novel constructions of coresets: for the k-median objective, we construct an \eps-coreset of size O(\Gamma k^2 \eps^{-d}) where \Gamma is the number of distinct collections of groups that a point may belong to, and for the k-means objective, we show how to construct an \eps-coreset of size O(\Gamma k^3\eps^{-d-1}). The former result is the first known coreset construction for the fair clustering problem with the k-median objective, and the latter result removes the dependence on the size of the full dataset as in~\cite{schmidt2018fair} and generalizes it to multiple, non-disjoint attributes. Importantly, plugging our coresets into existing algorithms for fair clustering such as \cite{backurs2019scalable} results in the fastest algorithms for several cases. Empirically, we assess our approach over the \textbf{Adult} and \textbf{Bank} dataset, and show that the coreset sizes are much smaller than the full dataset; applying coresets indeed accelerates the running time of computing the fair clustering objective while ensuring that the resulting objective difference is small.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/810dfbbebb17302018ae903e9cb7a483-Paper.pdf,2019,"clustering, objective, cite, coreset, eps, fair, algorithms, approach, coresets, data","fair, clustering, coreset, median, means, size, coresets, time, algorithm, problem","{'coresets': 0.5755957318301526, 'constraints': 0.49890381231516034, 'fairness': 0.4707416790616642, 'clustering': 0.4451817731562192}","{'clustering': 0.30608817631522095, 'coreset': 0.2884006735052367, 'eps': 0.2583574863640567, 'cite': 0.2328809566052846, 'fair': 0.23053751253974825, 'disjoint': 0.2163005051289275, 'coresets': 0.2103737112196522, 'gamma': 0.19719310780984844, 'median': 0.19719310780984844, 'objective': 0.19303141855402645}"
You Only Propagate Once: Accelerating Adversarial Training via Maximal Principle,"Dinghuai Zhang, Tianyuan Zhang, Yiping Lu, Zhanxing Zhu, Bin Dong","Deep learning achieves state-of-the-art results in many tasks in computer vision and natural language processing. However, recent works have shown that deep networks can be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations which raised a serious robustness issue of deep networks. Adversarial training, typically formulated as a robust optimization problem, is an effective way of improving the robustness of deep networks. A major drawback of existing adversarial training algorithms is the computational overhead of the generation of adversarial examples, typically far greater than that of the network training. This leads to unbearable overall computational cost of adversarial training. In this paper, we show that adversarial training can be cast as a discrete time differential game. Through analyzing the Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle (PMP) of the problem, we observe that the adversary update is only coupled with the parameters of the first layer of the network. This inspires us to restrict most of the forward and back propagation within the first layer of the network during adversary updates.

On the Hardness of Robust Classification,"Pascale Gourdeau, Varun Kanade, Marta Kwiatkowska, James Worrell","It is becoming increasingly important to understand the vulnerability of machine learning models to adversarial attacks.  In this paper we study the feasibility of robust learning from the perspective of computational learning theory, considering both sample and computational complexity.  In particular, our definition of robust learnability requires polynomial sample complexity.  We start with two negative results.  We show that no non-trivial concept class can be robustly learned in the distribution-free setting against an adversary who can perturb just a single input bit.  We show moreover that the class of monotone conjunctions cannot be robustly learned under the uniform distribution against an adversary who can perturb $\omega(\log n)$ input bits. However if the adversary is restricted to perturbing $O(\log n)$ bits, then the class of monotone conjunctions can be robustly learned with respect to a general class of distributions (that includes the uniform distribution). Finally, we provide a simple proof of the computational hardness of robust learning on the boolean hypercube. Unlike previous results of this nature, our result does not rely on another computational model (e.g. the statistical query model) nor on any hardness assumption other than the existence of a hard learning problem in the PAC framework.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/8133415ea4647b6345849fb38311cf32-Paper.pdf,2019,"learning, class, computational, adversary, distribution, learned, robust, robustly, bits, complexity","learning, robust, distribution, class, concept, risk, c1, c2, c0, robustly","{'hardness': 0.7470593118289847, 'classification': 0.4902143042594763, 'robust': 0.4489903345385079}","{'adversary': 0.2768674999265728, 'robustly': 0.2768674999265728, 'conjunctions': 0.2515250002990294, 'computational': 0.23859417340259018, 'perturb': 0.21502278142406342, 'class': 0.21311553942765207, 'hardness': 0.19805021619975413, 'monotone': 0.19805021619975413, 'bits': 0.18457833328438183, 'robust': 0.17364805018420026}"
Adaptive Temporal-Difference Learning for Policy Evaluation with Per-State Uncertainty Estimates,"Carlos Riquelme, Hugo Penedones, Damien Vincent, Hartmut Maennel, Sylvain Gelly, Timothy A. Mann, Andre Barreto, Gergely Neu","We consider the core reinforcement-learning problem of on-policy value function approximation from a batch of trajectory data, and focus on various issues of Temporal Difference (TD) learning and Monte Carlo (MC) policy evaluation. The two methods are known to achieve complementary bias-variance trade-off properties, with TD tending to achieve lower variance but potentially higher bias. In this paper, we argue that the larger bias of TD can be a result of the amplification of local approximation errors. We address this by proposing an algorithm that adaptively switches between TD and MC in each state, thus mitigating the propagation of errors. Our method is based on learned confidence intervals that detect biases of TD estimates. We demonstrate in a variety of policy evaluation tasks that this simple adaptive algorithm performs competitively with the best approach in hindsight, suggesting that learned confidence intervals are a powerful technique for adapting policy evaluation to use TD or MC returns in a data-driven way.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/816a6db41f0e44644bc65808b6db5ca4-Paper.pdf,2019,"td, policy, bias, evaluation, mc, achieve, algorithm, approximation, confidence, data","td, mc, policy, function, state, value, adaptive, data, evaluation, algorithm","{'estimates': 0.40329972975019784, 'per': 0.38710619457648415, 'difference': 0.37454551286212495, 'evaluation': 0.3207600681798489, 'temporal': 0.3127049658054326, 'state': 0.3056595710729612, 'uncertainty': 0.3056595710729612, 'policy': 0.27184219567173845, 'adaptive': 0.26038167324525674, 'learning': 0.13412688781156276}","{'td': 0.579002999110216, 'mc': 0.30149534129799194, 'policy': 0.23214500866388094, 'bias': 0.19514250633413044, 'evaluation': 0.19160574445389217, 'intervals': 0.18964881824319849, 'confidence': 0.15469504335860199, 'errors': 0.14475643759819562, 'variance': 0.1359938482444782, 'tending': 0.11397738729400092}"
Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with Advantage-Based Auxiliary Rewards,"Siyuan Li, Rui Wang, Minxue Tang, Chongjie Zhang","Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) is a promising approach to solving long-horizon problems with sparse and delayed rewards. Many existing HRL algorithms either use pre-trained low-level skills that are unadaptable, or require domain-specific information to define low-level rewards. In this paper, we aim to adapt low-level skills to downstream tasks while maintaining the generality of reward design. We propose an HRL framework which sets auxiliary rewards for low-level skill training based on the advantage function of the high-level policy. This auxiliary reward enables efficient, simultaneous learning of the high-level policy and low-level skills without using task-specific knowledge. In addition, we also theoretically prove that optimizing low-level skills with this auxiliary reward will increase the task return for the joint policy.

Chasing Ghosts: Instruction Following as Bayesian State Tracking,"Peter Anderson, Ayush Shrivastava, Devi Parikh, Dhruv Batra, Stefan Lee","A visually-grounded navigation instruction can be interpreted as a sequence of expected observations and actions an agent following the correct trajectory would encounter and perform. Based on this intuition, we formulate the problem of finding the goal location in Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) within the framework of Bayesian state tracking - learning observation and motion models conditioned on these expectable events. Together with a mapper that constructs a semantic spatial map on-the-fly during navigation, we formulate an end-to-end differentiable Bayes filter and train it to identify the goal by predicting the most likely trajectory through the map according to the instructions. The resulting navigation policy constitutes a new approach to instruction following that explicitly models a probability distribution over states, encoding strong geometric and algorithmic priors while enabling greater explainability. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms a strong LingUNet baseline when predicting the goal location on the map.

Near-Optimal Reinforcement Learning in Dynamic Treatment Regimes,"Junzhe Zhang, Elias Bareinboim","A dynamic treatment regime (DTR) consists of a sequence of decision rules, one per stage of intervention, that dictates how to determine the treatment assignment to patients based on evolving treatments and covariates' history.

In this paper, we investigate the online reinforcement learning (RL) problem for selecting optimal DTRs provided that observational data is available. We develop the first adaptive algorithm that achieves near-optimal regret in DTRs in online settings, without any access to historical data.

Divide and Couple: Using Monte Carlo Variational Objectives for Posterior Approximation,"Justin Domke, Daniel R.

Developing such a connection is important if the ideas are to be applied to inference—i.e., applications that require an approximate posterior and not just an approximation of the log-likelihood. Given a VI objective defined by a Monte Carlo estimator of the likelihood, we use a ""divide and couple"" procedure to identify augmented proposal and target distributions so that the gap between the VI objective and the log-likelihood is equal to the divergence between these distributions.

Numerically Accurate Hyperbolic Embeddings Using Tiling-Based Models,"Tao Yu, Christopher M.

To address this, we propose a new model which uses an integer-based tiling to represent \emph{any} point in hyperbolic space with provably bounded numerical error. This allows us to learn high-precision embeddings without using BigFloats, and enables us to store the resulting embeddings with fewer bits.

We first prove instance-dependent lower bounds on the cumulative regret for each of these models, indicating how the complexity of the bandit problems increases with the generality of the ordering concept  considered. We also provide algorithms  that fully leverage the structure of the model with their associated theoretical guarantees. Finally, we have conducted an  analysis on real data to highlight that those ordered categories actually exist in practice.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/83462e22a65e7e34975bbf2b639333ec-Paper.pdf,2019,"bandit, categories, introduce, one, ordered, ordering, stochastic, actually, algorithms, also","dominance, category, arms, categories, cat, order, regret, algorithm, ﬁrst, arm","{'categorized': 0.8379118293212025, 'bandits': 0.5458056121767125}","{'categories': 0.3491241185474042, 'bandit': 0.27394624626711406, 'ordered': 0.2678131626618071, 'ordering': 0.2678131626618071, 'appetence': 0.1566385323742643, 'dominance': 0.1566385323742643, 'customer': 0.14824884560088958, 'motivating': 0.14824884560088958, 'commerce': 0.14229626810427828, 'grouped': 0.14229626810427828}"
Curriculum-guided Hindsight Experience Replay,"Meng Fang, Tianyi Zhou, Yali Du, Lei Han, Zhengyou Zhang","In off-policy deep reinforcement learning, it is usually hard to collect sufficient successful experiences with sparse rewards to learn from. Hindsight experience replay (HER) enables an agent to learn from failures by treating the achieved state of a failed experience as a pseudo goal. However, not all the failed experiences are equally useful to different learning stages, so it is not efficient to replay all of them or uniform samples of them. In this paper, we propose to 1) adaptively select the failed experiences for replay according to the proximity to the true goals and the curiosity of exploration over diverse pseudo goals, and 2) gradually change the proportion of the goal-proximity and the diversity-based curiosity in the selection criteria: we adopt a human-like learning strategy that enforces more curiosity in earlier stages and changes to larger goal-proximity later.

Random Path Selection for Continual Learning,"Jathushan Rajasegaran, Munawar Hayat, Salman H. Khan, Fahad Shahbaz Khan, Ling Shao","Incremental life-long learning is a main challenge towards the long-standing goal of Artificial General Intelligence. In real-life settings, learning tasks arrive in a sequence and machine learning models must continually learn to increment already acquired knowledge. The existing incremental learning approaches fall well below the state-of-the-art cumulative models that use all training classes at once. In this paper, we propose a random path selection algorithm, called RPS-Net, that progressively chooses optimal paths for the new tasks while encouraging parameter sharing and reuse. Our approach avoids the overhead introduced by computationally expensive evolutionary and reinforcement learning based path selection strategies  while achieving considerable performance gains. As an added novelty, the proposed model integrates knowledge distillation and retrospection along with the path selection strategy to overcome catastrophic forgetting. In order to maintain an equilibrium between previous and newly acquired knowledge, we propose a simple controller to dynamically balance the model plasticity.  Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses the state-of-the-art performance on incremental learning and by utilizing parallel computation this method can run in constant time with nearly the same efficiency as a conventional deep convolutional neural network.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/83da7c539e1ab4e759623c38d8737e9e-Paper.pdf,2019,"learning, incremental, knowledge, path, selection, acquired, art, life, long, method","tasks, learning, task, path, network, 10, classes, paths, model, new","{'path': 0.575047654092441, 'continual': 0.4784155463699382, 'selection': 0.47076585234959945, 'random': 0.42689968683568336, 'learning': 0.19124573238502482}","{'incremental': 0.2939085725490561, 'path': 0.26652204477723845, 'acquired': 0.22973230361580918, 'selection': 0.21147214555873547, 'life': 0.190358486646127, 'knowledge': 0.17630189392943318, 'learning': 0.1665708837248246, 'long': 0.13926794102127557, 'increment': 0.12644369159059246, 'retrospection': 0.12644369159059246}"
Learning Multiple Markov Chains via Adaptive Allocation,"Mohammad Sadegh Talebi, Odalric-Ambrym Maillard","We study the problem of learning the transition matrices of a set of Markov chains from a single stream of observations on each chain. We assume that the Markov chains are ergodic but otherwise unknown. The learner can sample Markov chains sequentially to observe their states. The goal of the learner is to sequentially select various chains to learn transition matrices uniformly well with respect to some loss function. We introduce a notion of loss that naturally extends the squared loss for learning distributions to the case of Markov chains, and further characterize the notion of being \emph{uniformly good} in all problem instances. We present a novel learning algorithm that efficiently balances \emph{exploration} and \emph{exploitation} intrinsic to this problem, without any prior knowledge of the chains.

Motivated by this discovery, two possible approaches are proposed to increase robustness: a carefully designed loss with corresponding training algorithms for deep fusion models, and a simple convolutional fusion layer that has a structural advantage in dealing with noise.

GENO -- GENeric Optimization for Classical Machine Learning,"Soeren Laue, Matthias Mitterreiter, Joachim Giesen","Although optimization is the longstanding, algorithmic backbone of machine learning new models still require the time-consuming implementation of new solvers. As a result, there are thousands of implementations of optimization algorithms for machine learning problems. A natural question is, if it is always necessary to implement a new solver, or is there one algorithm that is sufficient for most models. Common belief suggests that such a one-algorithm-fits-all approach cannot work, because this algorithm cannot exploit model specific structure. At least, a generic algorithm cannot be efficient and robust on a wide variety of problems. Here, we challenge this common belief. We have designed and implemented the optimization framework GENO (GENeric Optimization) that combines a modeling language with a generic solver. GENO takes the declaration of an optimization problem and generates a solver for the specified problem class. The framework is flexible enough to encompass most of the classical machine learning problems. We show on a wide variety of classical but also some recently suggested problems that the automatically generated solvers are (1) as efficient as well engineered, specialized solvers, (2) more efficient by a decent margin than recent state-of-the-art solvers, and (3) orders of magnitude more efficient than classical modeling language plus solver approaches.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/84438b7aae55a0638073ef798e50b4ef-Paper.pdf,2019,"optimization, algorithm, efficient, problems, solver, solvers, cannot, classical, generic, learning","problems, 10, geno, problem, solver, optimization, learning, non, also, solvers","{'classical': 0.5140205662887473, 'geno': 0.5140205662887473, 'generic': 0.48648920806629353, 'machine': 0.3687086097510456, 'optimization': 0.26976060284482706, 'learning': 0.1617935213402204}","{'solver': 0.35243019071119014, 'solvers': 0.3311867138363866, 'generic': 0.23456278883637965, 'geno': 0.2308554474879685, 'optimization': 0.20995608495694307, 'classical': 0.19552156788438876, 'cannot': 0.19147086613310474, 'efficient': 0.17903542619318683, 'belief': 0.17886853872223424, 'problems': 0.17257981227556912}"
Failing Loudly: An Empirical Study of Methods for Detecting Dataset Shift,"Stephan Rabanser, Stephan Günnemann, Zachary Lipton","We might hope that when faced with unexpected inputs, well-designed software systems would fire off warnings.

We focus on several datasets and various perturbations to both covariates and label distributions with varying magnitudes and fractions of data affected.

In an attempt to encourage the use of continuous-time methods in optimization, we show that, if some additional regularity on the objective is assumed, the ODE representations of Gradient Descent and Heavy-ball do not suffer from the aforementioned problem, once we allow for a small perturbation on the algorithm initial condition.

To overcome the poor landscape, we develop a convex surrogate that is calibrated with respect to entropy regularized expected reward.  We then consider the partially observed case, where rewards are recorded for only a subset of actions.

Bayesian Batch Active Learning as Sparse Subset Approximation,"Robert Pinsler, Jonathan Gordon, Eric Nalisnick, José Miguel Hernández-Lobato","Leveraging the wealth of unlabeled data produced in recent years provides great potential for improving supervised models. When the cost of acquiring labels is high, probabilistic active learning methods can be used to greedily select the most informative data points to be labeled. However, for many large-scale problems standard greedy procedures become computationally infeasible and suffer from negligible model change. In this paper, we introduce a novel Bayesian batch active learning approach that mitigates these issues. Our approach is motivated by approximating the complete data posterior of the model parameters. While naive batch construction methods result in correlated queries, our algorithm produces diverse batches that enable efficient active learning at scale.

Putting An End to End-to-End: Gradient-Isolated Learning of Representations,"Sindy Löwe, Peter O'Connor, Bastiaan Veeling","We propose a novel deep learning method for local self-supervised representation learning that does not require labels nor end-to-end backpropagation but exploits the natural order in data instead.

Each module is trained to maximally preserve the information of its inputs using the InfoNCE bound from Oord et al [2018]. Despite this greedy training, we demonstrate that each module improves upon the output of its predecessor, and that the representations created by the top module yield highly competitive results on downstream classification tasks in the audio and visual domain.

Modular Universal Reparameterization: Deep Multi-task Learning Across Diverse Domains,"Elliot Meyerson, Risto Miikkulainen","As deep learning applications continue to become more diverse, an interesting question arises: Can general problem solving arise from jointly learning several such diverse tasks? To approach this question, deep multi-task learning is extended in this paper to the setting where there is no obvious overlap between task architectures. The idea is that any set of (architecture,task) pairs can be decomposed into a set of potentially related subproblems, whose sharing is optimized by an efficient stochastic algorithm. The approach is first validated in a classic synthetic multi-task learning benchmark, and then applied to sharing across disparate architectures for vision, NLP, and genomics tasks. It discovers regularities across these domains, encodes them into sharable modules, and combines these modules systematically to improve performance in the individual tasks. The results confirm that sharing learned functionality across diverse domains and architectures is indeed beneficial, thus establishing a key ingredient for general problem solving in the future.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/8526e0962a844e4a2f158d831d5fddf7-Paper.pdf,2019,"learning, task, across, architectures, diverse, sharing, tasks, approach, deep, domains","task, across, muir, tasks, model, pseudo, sharing, parameters, modules, architectures","{'reparameterization': 0.4080402424969921, 'domains': 0.3861852763300333, 'diverse': 0.3586512752498635, 'modular': 0.3586512752498635, 'across': 0.34882396489551315, 'universal': 0.33331761962795187, 'task': 0.2959563081934317, 'multi': 0.23139893395641845, 'deep': 0.19155326673316106, 'learning': 0.12843507052404693}","{'sharing': 0.29028052815972777, 'diverse': 0.26112129706362364, 'task': 0.2252876925417783, 'architectures': 0.2229998910461751, 'modules': 0.20895034130915285, 'across': 0.19384065995007094, 'question': 0.15619485977437006, 'domains': 0.15278466586776948, 'solving': 0.152244869075412, 'tasks': 0.14745319863144696}"
Decentralized Cooperative Stochastic Bandits,"David Martínez-Rubio, Varun Kanade, Patrick Rebeschini","We study a decentralized cooperative stochastic multi-armed bandit problem with K arms on a network of N agents. In our model, the reward distribution of each arm is the same for each agent and rewards are drawn independently across agents and time steps. In each round, each agent chooses an arm to play and subsequently sends a message to her neighbors. The goal is to minimize the overall regret of the entire network. We design a fully decentralized algorithm that uses an accelerated consensus procedure to compute (delayed) estimates of the average of rewards obtained by all the agents for each arm, and then uses an upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm that accounts for the delay and error of the estimates. We analyze the regret of our algorithm and also provide a lower bound. The regret is bounded by the optimal centralized regret plus a natural and simple term depending on the spectral gap of the communication matrix.

Quantifying uncertainty is especially critical in real-world settings, which often involve input distributions that are shifted from the training distribution due to a variety of factors including sample bias and non-stationarity.  In such settings, well calibrated uncertainty estimates convey information about when a model's output should (or should not) be trusted.  Many probabilistic deep learning methods, including Bayesian-and non-Bayesian methods, have been proposed in the literature for quantifying predictive uncertainty, but to our knowledge there has not previously been a rigorous large-scale empirical comparison of these methods under dataset shift. We present a large-scale benchmark of existing state-of-the-art methods on classification problems and investigate the effect of dataset shift on accuracy and calibration.

"Non-Stationary Markov Decision Processes, a Worst-Case Approach using Model-Based Reinforcement Learning","Erwan Lecarpentier, Emmanuel Rachelson","This work tackles the problem of robust zero-shot planning in non-stationary stochastic environments. We study Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) evolving over time and consider Model-Based Reinforcement Learning algorithms in this setting. We make two hypotheses: 1) the environment evolves continuously with a bounded evolution rate; 2) a current model is known at each decision epoch but not its evolution. Our contribution can be presented in four points. 1) we define a specific class of MDPs that we call Non-Stationary MDPs (NSMDPs). We introduce the notion of regular evolution by making an hypothesis of Lipschitz-Continuity on the transition and reward functions w.r.t. time; 2) we consider a planning agent using the current model of the environment but unaware of its future evolution. This leads us to consider a worst-case method where the environment is seen as an adversarial agent; 3) following this approach, we propose the Risk-Averse Tree-Search (RATS) algorithm, a zero-shot Model-Based method similar to Minimax search; 4) we illustrate the benefits brought by RATS empirically and compare its performance with reference Model-Based algorithms.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/859b00aec8885efc83d1541b52a1220d-Paper.pdf,2019,"model, evolution, based, consider, environment, mdps, agent, algorithms, current, decision","nsmdp, t0, decision, model, al, et, case, worst, evolution, stationary","{'stationary': 0.3694476871193336, 'worst': 0.3694476871193336, 'case': 0.31510252191722793, 'decision': 0.3061280521200004, 'markov': 0.2949732622705024, 'approach': 0.2857411327865465, 'non': 0.2688908396955848, 'processes': 0.26120318451612323, 'using': 0.23595367694641584, 'model': 0.23484596880138944}","{'evolution': 0.3976905381606137, 'mdps': 0.26786681506613985, 'rats': 0.2566382769285384, 'environment': 0.21460875735224427, 'planning': 0.1723969569545399, 'model': 0.1657117130857325, 'stationary': 0.15960622936215982, 'consider': 0.15756652662520176, 'shot': 0.1559376588707939, 'zero': 0.14490544864106195}"
Optimal Decision Tree with Noisy Outcomes,"Su Jia, viswanath nagarajan, Fatemeh Navidi, R Ravi","A fundamental task in active learning involves performing a sequence of tests to identify an unknown hypothesis that is drawn from a known distribution. This problem, known as optimal decision tree induction, has been widely studied for decades and the asymptotically best-possible approximation algorithm has been devised for it. We study a generalization where certain test outcomes are noisy, even in the more general case when the noise is persistent, i.e., repeating the test on the scenario gives the same noisy output, disallowing simple repetition as a way to gain confidence. 
We design new approximation algorithms for both the non-adaptive setting, where the test sequence must be fixed a-priori, and the adaptive setting  where the test sequence depends on the outcomes of prior tests. 
Previous work in the area assumed at most a constant number of noisy outcomes per test and per scenario and provided approximation ratios that were problem dependent (such as the minimum probability of a hypothesis). Our new approximation algorithms provide guarantees that are nearly best-possible and work for the general case of a large number of noisy outcomes per test or per hypothesis where the performance degrades smoothly with this number. 
Our results adapt and generalize methods used for submodular ranking and stochastic set cover. 
We evaluate the performance of our algorithms on two natural applications with noise: toxic chemical identification and active learning of linear classifiers.

Generalization Bounds for Neural Networks via Approximate Description Length,"Amit Daniely, Elad Granot","We investigate the sample complexity of networks with bounds on the magnitude of its weights. 
In particular, we consider the class
\[
\cn = \left\{W_t\circ\rho\circ W_{t-1}\circ\rho\ldots\circ \rho\circ W_{1} : W_1,\ldots,W_{t-1}\in M_{d\times d}, W_t\in M_{1,d}  \right\}
\]
where the spectral norm of each $W_i$ is bounded by $O(1)$, the Frobenius norm is bounded by $R$, and $\rho$ is the sigmoid function $\frac{e^x}{1 + e^x}$ or the smoothened ReLU function $ \ln\left(1 + e^x\right)$.
We show that for any depth $t$, if the inputs are in $[-1,1]^d$, the sample complexity of $\cn$ is $\tilde O\left(\frac{dR^2}{\epsilon^2}\right)$. This bound is optimal up to log-factors, and substantially improves over the previous state of the art of $\tilde O\left(\frac{d^2R^2}{\epsilon^2}\right)$, that was established in a recent line of work.

We furthermore show that this bound remains valid if instead of considering the magnitude of the $W_i$'s, we consider the magnitude of $W_i - W_i^0$, where $W_i^0$ are some reference matrices, with spectral norm of $O(1)$. By taking the $W_i^0$ to be the matrices in the onset of the training process, we get sample complexity bounds that are sub-linear in the number of parameters, in many {\em typical} regimes of parameters.  

To establish our results we develop a new technique to analyze the sample complexity of families $\ch$ of predictors. 
We start by defining a new notion of a randomized approximate description of functions $f:\cx\to\reals^d$. We then show that if there is a way to approximately describe functions in a class $\ch$ using $d$ bits, then $\frac{d}{\epsilon^2}$ examples suffices to guarantee uniform convergence. Namely, that the empirical loss of all the functions in the class is $\epsilon$-close to the true loss.

The proposed approach performs task inference directly within the model, is able to dynamically expand to capture new concepts over its lifetime, and incorporates additional rehearsal-based techniques to deal with catastrophic forgetting. 
We demonstrate the efficacy of CURL in an unsupervised learning setting with MNIST and Omniglot, where the lack of labels ensures no information is leaked about the task.

An  Inexact Augmented Lagrangian Framework for Nonconvex Optimization with Nonlinear Constraints,"Mehmet Fatih Sahin, Armin eftekhari, Ahmet Alacaoglu, Fabian Latorre, Volkan Cevher","We propose a practical inexact augmented Lagrangian method (iALM) for nonconvex problems with nonlinear constraints. We characterize the total computational complexity of our method subject to a verifiable geometric condition, which is closely related to the Polyak-Lojasiewicz and Mangasarian-Fromowitz conditions. In particular, when a first-order solver is used for the inner iterates, we prove that iALM  finds a first-order stationary point with $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\epsilon^3)$ calls to the first-order oracle. {If, in addition, the problem is smooth and} a second-order solver is used for the inner iterates, iALM  finds a second-order stationary point with $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\epsilon^5)$ calls to the second-order oracle.

A Robust Non-Clairvoyant Dynamic Mechanism for Contextual Auctions,"Yuan Deng, Sébastien Lahaie, Vahab Mirrokni","Dynamic mechanisms offer powerful techniques to improve on both revenue and efficiency by linking sequential auctions using state information, but these techniques rely on exact distributional information of the buyers’ valuations (present and future), which limits their use in learning settings. In this paper, we consider the problem of contextual auctions where the seller gradually learns a model of the buyer's valuation as a function of the context (e.g., item features) and seeks a pricing policy that optimizes revenue. Building on the concept of a bank account mechanism---a special class of dynamic mechanisms that is known to be revenue-optimal---we develop a non-clairvoyant dynamic mechanism that is robust to both estimation errors in the buyer's value distribution and strategic behavior on the part of the buyer. We then tailor its structure to achieve a policy with provably low regret against a constant approximation of the optimal dynamic mechanism in contextual auctions. Our result substantially improves on previous results that only provide revenue guarantees against static benchmarks.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/8685549650016d9e1d14bf972262450b-Paper.pdf,2019,"dynamic, revenue, auctions, buyer, mechanism, contextual, information, mechanisms, optimal, policy","mechanism, buyer, stage, dynamic, revenue, ft, vt, auction, al, clairvoyant","{'clairvoyant': 0.47334579712484504, 'mechanism': 0.4300049255618328, 'auctions': 0.4046521409488987, 'contextual': 0.36131126938588637, 'dynamic': 0.3433231824358082, 'non': 0.3129655145742226, 'robust': 0.284485695363546}","{'revenue': 0.41156895859513815, 'buyer': 0.3432760510849101, 'auctions': 0.31534210998294065, 'dynamic': 0.28828344923198174, 'mechanism': 0.20410481113849938, 'contextual': 0.17212090642640707, 'mechanisms': 0.1678669284322106, 'policy': 0.12140336321436193, 'clairvoyant': 0.11921202379080492, 'linking': 0.11921202379080492}"
Multiple Futures Prediction,"Charlie Tang, Russ R. Salakhutdinov","Temporal prediction is critical for making intelligent and robust decisions in complex dynamic environments. Motion prediction needs to model the inherently uncertain future which often contains multiple potential outcomes, due to multi-agent interactions and the latent goals of others. Towards these goals, we introduce a probabilistic framework that efficiently learns latent variables to jointly model the multi-step future motions of agents in a scene. Our framework is data-driven and learns semantically meaningful latent variables to represent the multimodal future, without requiring explicit labels. Using a dynamic attention-based state encoder, we learn to encode the past as well as the future interactions among agents, efficiently scaling to any number of agents. Finally, our model can be used for planning via computing a conditional probability density over the trajectories of other agents given a hypothetical rollout of the ego agent.

Multiview Aggregation for Learning Category-Specific Shape Reconstruction,"Srinath Sridhar, Davis Rempe, Julien Valentin, Bouaziz Sofien, Leonidas J. Guibas","We investigate the problem of learning category-specific 3D shape reconstruction from a variable number of RGB views of previously unobserved object instances. Most approaches for multiview shape reconstruction operate on sparse shape representations, or assume a fixed number of views. We present a method that can estimate dense 3D shape, and aggregate shape across multiple and varying number of input views. Given a single input view of an object instance, we propose a representation that encodes the dense shape of the visible object surface as well as the surface behind line of sight occluded by the visible surface. When multiple input views are available, the shape representation is designed to be aggregated into a single 3D shape using an inexpensive union operation. We train a 2D CNN to learn to predict this representation from a variable number of views (1 or more). We further aggregate multiview information by using permutation equivariant layers that promote order-agnostic view information exchange at the feature level. Experiments show that our approach is able to produce dense 3D reconstructions of objects that improve in quality as more views are added.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/86e8f7ab32cfd12577bc2619bc635690-Paper.pdf,2019,"shape, views, 3d, number, dense, input, object, representation, surface, aggregate","nocs, shape, views, 3d, object, maps, multiview, surface, view, reconstruction","{'multiview': 0.4510828993257306, 'category': 0.42692253356638954, 'shape': 0.40978048125695604, 'specific': 0.38562011549761505, 'aggregation': 0.37643477073625004, 'reconstruction': 0.3684780631881815, 'learning': 0.14198321134347144}","{'shape': 0.50433587984049, 'views': 0.42728574890181314, '3d': 0.2274384969877153, 'surface': 0.2199060427913269, 'dense': 0.20827775766741186, 'multiview': 0.17907905228152296, 'visible': 0.16175413428550156, 'object': 0.15822608468710464, 'aggregate': 0.14898626580068286, 'number': 0.1378699702921464}"
Reinforcement Learning with Convex Constraints,"Sobhan Miryoosefi, Kianté Brantley, Hal Daume III, Miro Dudik, Robert E. Schapire","In standard reinforcement learning (RL), a learning agent seeks to optimize the overall reward. However, many key aspects of a desired behavior are more naturally expressed as constraints. For instance, the designer may want to limit the use of unsafe actions, increase the diversity of trajectories to enable exploration, or approximate expert trajectories when rewards are sparse. In this paper, we propose an algorithmic scheme that can handle a wide class of constraints in RL tasks: specifically, any constraints that require expected values of some vector measurements (such as the use of an action) to lie in a convex set. This captures previously studied constraints (such as safety and proximity to an expert), but also enables new classes of constraints (such as diversity). Our approach comes with rigorous theoretical guarantees and only relies on the ability to approximately solve standard RL tasks. As a result, it can be easily adapted to work with any model-free or model-based RL. In our experiments, we show that it matches previous algorithms that enforce safety via constraints, but can also enforce new properties that these algorithms do not incorporate, such as diversity.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/873be0705c80679f2c71fbf4d872df59-Paper.pdf,2019,"constraints, rl, diversity, algorithms, also, enforce, expert, learning, model, new","algorithm, policy, reward, set, convex, oracle, learning, constraints, appropo, problem","{'constraints': 0.6485245056196766, 'convex': 0.5579046216506558, 'reinforcement': 0.44827409459050166, 'learning': 0.25924647513642046}","{'constraints': 0.419937775253945, 'rl': 0.322178268953458, 'diversity': 0.27615837115959924, 'enforce': 0.20877788921013074, 'expert': 0.191248377327072, 'safety': 0.191248377327072, 'trajectories': 0.18410558077306619, 'designer': 0.13472887234250955, 'unsafe': 0.12751268472155505, 'standard': 0.11507354181976795}"
Regularization Matters: Generalization and Optimization of Neural Nets v.s. their Induced Kernel,"Colin Wei, Jason D. Lee, Qiang Liu, Tengyu Ma","Recent works have shown that on sufficiently over-parametrized neural nets, gradient descent with relatively large initialization optimizes a prediction function in the RKHS of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). This analysis leads to global convergence results but does not work when there is a standard $\ell_2$ regularizer, which is useful to have in practice. We show that sample efficiency can indeed depend on the presence of the regularizer: we construct a simple distribution in $d$ dimensions which the optimal regularized neural net learns with $O(d)$ samples but the NTK requires $\Omega(d^2)$ samples to learn. To prove this, we establish two analysis tools: i) for multi-layer feedforward ReLU nets, we show that the global minimizer of a weakly-regularized cross-entropy loss is the max normalized margin solution among all neural nets, which generalizes well; ii) we develop a new technique for proving lower bounds for kernel methods, which relies on showing that the kernel cannot focus on informative features. Motivated by our generalization results, we study whether the regularized global optimum is attainable.

Learning Hawkes Processes from a handful of events,"Farnood Salehi, William Trouleau, Matthias Grossglauser, Patrick Thiran","Learning the causal-interaction network of multivariate Hawkes processes is a useful task in many applications. Maximum-likelihood estimation is the most common approach to solve the problem in the presence of long observation sequences. However, when only short sequences are available, the lack of data amplifies the risk of overfitting and regularization becomes critical. Due to the challenges of hyper-parameter tuning, state-of-the-art methods only parameterize regularizers by a single shared hyper-parameter, hence limiting the power of representation of the model. To solve both issues, we develop in this work an efficient algorithm based on variational expectation-maximization. Our approach is able to optimize over an extended set of hyper-parameters. It is also able to take into account the uncertainty in the model parameters by learning a posterior distribution over them.

MetaInit: Initializing learning by learning to initialize,"Yann N. Dauphin, Samuel Schoenholz","Deep learning models frequently trade handcrafted features for deep features learned with much less human intervention using gradient descent. While this paradigm has been enormously successful, deep networks are often difficult to train and performance can depend crucially on the initial choice of parameters. In this work, we introduce an algorithm called MetaInit as a step towards automating the search for good initializations using meta-learning. Our approach is based on a hypothesis that good initializations make gradient descent easier by starting in regions that look locally linear with minimal second order effects. We formalize this notion via a quantity that we call the gradient quotient, which can be computed with any architecture or dataset. MetaInit minimizes this quantity efficiently by using gradient descent to tune the norms of the initial weight matrices. We conduct experiments on plain and residual networks and show that the algorithm can automatically recover from a class of bad initializations. MetaInit allows us to train networks and achieve performance competitive with the state-of-the-art without batch normalization or residual connections.

"Time Matters in Regularizing Deep Networks: Weight Decay and Data Augmentation Affect Early Learning Dynamics, Matter Little Near Convergence","Aditya Sharad Golatkar, Alessandro Achille, Stefano Soatto","Regularization is typically understood as improving generalization by altering the landscape of local extrema to which the model eventually converges. Deep neural networks (DNNs), however, challenge this view: We show that removing regularization after an initial transient period has little effect on generalization, even if the final loss landscape is the same as if there had been no regularization. In some cases, generalization even improves after interrupting regularization. Conversely, if regularization is applied only after the initial transient, it has no effect on the final solution, whose generalization gap is as bad as if regularization never happened. This suggests that what matters for training deep networks is not just whether or how, but when to regularize. The phenomena we observe are manifest in different datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, ImageNet), different architectures (ResNet-18, All-CNN), different regularization methods (weight decay, data augmentation, mixup), different learning rate schedules (exponential, piece-wise constant).

Controllable Unsupervised Text Attribute Transfer via Editing Entangled Latent Representation,"Ke Wang, Hang Hua, Xiaojun Wan","Unsupervised text attribute transfer automatically transforms a text to alter a specific attribute (e.g. sentiment) without using any parallel data, while simultaneously preserving its attribute-independent content. The dominant approaches are trying to model the content-independent attribute separately, e.g., learning different attributes' representations or using multiple attribute-specific decoders. However, it may lead to inflexibility from the perspective of controlling the degree of transfer or transferring over multiple aspects at the same time. To address the above problems, we propose a more flexible unsupervised text attribute transfer framework which replaces the process of modeling attribute with minimal editing of latent representations based on an attribute classifier. Specifically, we first propose a Transformer-based autoencoder to learn an entangled latent representation for a discrete text, then we transform the attribute transfer task to an optimization problem and propose the Fast-Gradient-Iterative-Modification algorithm to edit the latent representation until conforming to the target attribute. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves very competitive performance on three public data sets.

"Accurate, reliable and fast robustness evaluation","Wieland Brendel, Jonas Rauber, Matthias Kümmerer, Ivan Ustyuzhaninov, Matthias Bethge","Throughout the past five years, the susceptibility of neural networks to minimal adversarial perturbations has moved from a peculiar phenomenon to a core issue in Deep Learning. Despite much attention, however, progress towards more robust models is significantly impaired by the difficulty of evaluating the robustness of neural network models. Today's methods are either fast but brittle (gradient-based attacks), or they are fairly reliable but slow (score- and decision-based attacks). We here develop a new set of gradient-based adversarial attacks which (a) are more reliable in the face of gradient-masking than other gradient-based attacks, (b) perform better and are more query efficient than current state-of-the-art gradient-based attacks, (c) can be flexibly adapted to a wide range of adversarial criteria and (d) require virtually no hyperparameter tuning.

From Complexity to Simplicity: Adaptive ES-Active Subspaces for Blackbox Optimization,"Krzysztof M. Choromanski, Aldo Pacchiano, Jack Parker-Holder, Yunhao Tang, Vikas Sindhwani","We present a new algorithm (ASEBO) for optimizing high-dimensional blackbox functions. ASEBO adapts to the geometry of the function and learns optimal sets of sensing directions, which are used to probe it, on-the-fly. It addresses the exploration-exploitation trade-off of blackbox optimization with expensive blackbox queries by continuously learning the bias of the lower-dimensional model used to approximate gradients of smoothings of the function via compressed sensing and contextual bandits methods. To obtain this model, it leverages techniques from the emerging theory of active subspaces in a novel ES blackbox optimization context. As a result, ASEBO learns the dynamically changing intrinsic dimensionality of the gradient space and adapts to the hardness of different stages of the optimization without external supervision. Consequently, it leads to more sample-efficient blackbox optimization than state-of-the-art algorithms.

We show that with prior knowledge of the rewards and delays of all the arms, the problem of optimizing cumulative reward does not admit any pseudo-polynomial time algorithm (in the number of arms) unless randomized exponential time hypothesis is false, by mapping to the PINWHEEL scheduling problem.  Subsequently, we show that a simple greedy algorithm that plays the available arm with the highest reward is asymptotically $(1-1/e)$ optimal. When the rewards are unknown, we design a UCB based algorithm which is shown to have $c \log T + o(\log T)$ cumulative regret against the greedy algorithm, leveraging the free exploration of arms due to the unavailability.

Third-Person Visual Imitation Learning via Decoupled Hierarchical Controller,"Pratyusha Sharma, Deepak Pathak, Abhinav Gupta","We study a generalized setup for learning from demonstration to build an agent that can manipulate novel objects in unseen scenarios by looking at only a single video of human demonstration from a third-person perspective. To accomplish this goal, our agent should not only learn to understand the intent of the demonstrated third-person video in its context but also perform the intended task in its environment configuration. Our central insight is to enforce this structure explicitly during learning by decoupling what to achieve (intended task) from how to perform it (controller). We propose a hierarchical setup where a high-level module learns to generate a series of first-person sub-goals conditioned on the third-person video demonstration, and a low-level controller predicts the actions to achieve those sub-goals. Our agent acts from raw image observations without any access to the full state information.

L_DMI: A Novel Information-theoretic Loss Function for Training Deep Nets Robust to Label Noise,"Yilun Xu, Peng Cao, Yuqing Kong, Yizhou Wang","Accurately annotating large scale dataset is notoriously expensive both in time and in money. Although acquiring low-quality-annotated dataset can be much cheaper, it often badly damages the performance of trained models when using such dataset without particular treatment. Various methods have been proposed for learning with noisy labels. However, most methods only handle limited kinds of noise patterns, require auxiliary information or steps (e.g., knowing or estimating the noise transition matrix), or lack theoretical justification. In this paper, we propose a novel information-theoretic loss function, LDMI, for training deep neural networks robust to label noise. The core of LDMI is a generalized version of mutual information, termed Determinant based Mutual Information (DMI), which is not only information-monotone but also relatively invariant. To the best of our knowledge, LDMI is the first loss function that is provably robust to instance-independent label noise, regardless of noise pattern, and it can be applied to any existing classification neural networks straightforwardly without any auxiliary information. In addition to theoretical justification, we also empirically show that using LDMI outperforms all other counterparts in the classification task on both image dataset and natural language dataset include Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, Dogs vs. Cats, MR with a variety of synthesized noise patterns and noise amounts, as well as a real-world dataset Clothing1M.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/8a1ee9f2b7abe6e88d1a479ab6a42c5e-Paper.pdf,2019,"noise, dataset, information, ldmi, also, auxiliary, classification, function, justification, label","noise, information, w1, w2, dmi, labels, loss, w3, classiﬁer, ldmi","{'l_dmi': 0.38789547064086605, 'novel': 0.331602675280136, 'theoretic': 0.31686187163127827, 'nets': 0.30542801603020353, 'label': 0.29608587577534207, 'loss': 0.2881872087353498, 'noise': 0.2846520201742674, 'function': 0.27823867192967644, 'information': 0.2725394803397864, 'training': 0.23439441702061573}","{'ldmi': 0.4175916465098153, 'noise': 0.3550896297290372, 'dataset': 0.2809818072728001, 'information': 0.24914695035866832, 'justification': 0.17849461728505017, 'mutual': 0.14670216456251473, 'auxiliary': 0.13805106681592785, 'patterns': 0.1314753698194474, 'label': 0.12417479282149116, 'badly': 0.10439791162745382}"

Connective Cognition Network for Directional Visual Commonsense Reasoning,"Aming Wu, Linchao Zhu, Yahong Han, Yi Yang","Visual commonsense reasoning (VCR) has been introduced to boost research of cognition-level visual understanding, i.e., a thorough understanding of correlated details of the scene plus an inference with related commonsense knowledge. Recent studies on neuroscience have suggested that brain function or cognition can be described as a global and dynamic integration of local neuronal connectivity, which is context-sensitive to specific cognition tasks. Inspired by this idea, towards VCR, we propose a connective cognition network (CCN) to dynamically reorganize the visual neuron connectivity that is contextualized by the meaning of questions and answers. Concretely, we first develop visual neuron connectivity to fully model correlations of visual content. Then, a contextualization process is introduced to fuse the sentence representation with that of visual neurons. Finally, based on the output of contextualized connectivity, we propose directional connectivity to infer answers or rationales.

Hierarchical Optimal Transport for Document Representation,"Mikhail Yurochkin, Sebastian Claici, Edward Chien, Farzaneh Mirzazadeh, Justin M. Solomon","The ability to measure similarity between documents enables intelligent summarization and analysis of large corpora. Past distances between documents suffer from either an inability to incorporate semantic similarities between words or from scalability issues. As an alternative, we introduce hierarchical optimal transport as a meta-distance between documents, where documents are modeled as distributions over topics, which themselves are modeled as distributions over words.

PerspectiveNet: A Scene-consistent Image Generator for New View Synthesis in Real Indoor Environments,"David Novotny, Ben Graham, Jeremy Reizenstein","Given a set of a reference RGBD views of an indoor environment, and a new viewpoint, our goal is to predict the view from that location. Prior work on new-view generation has predominantly focused on significantly constrained scenarios, typically involving artificially rendered views of isolated CAD models. Here we tackle a much more challenging version of the problem. We devise an approach that exploits known geometric properties of the scene (per-frame camera extrinsics and depth) in order to warp reference views into the new ones. The defects in the generated views are handled by a novel RGBD inpainting network, PerspectiveNet, that is fine-tuned for a given scene in order to obtain images that are geometrically consistent with all the views in the scene camera system.

Sequential Experimental Design for Transductive Linear Bandits,"Tanner Fiez, Lalit Jain, Kevin G. Jamieson, Lillian Ratliff","In this paper we introduce the pure exploration transductive linear bandit problem: given a set of measurement vectors $\mathcal{X}\subset \mathbb{R}^d$, a set of items $\mathcal{Z}\subset \mathbb{R}^d$, a fixed confidence $\delta$, and an unknown vector $\theta^{\ast}\in \mathbb{R}^d$, the goal is to infer $\arg\max_{z\in \mathcal{Z}} z^\top\theta^\ast$ with probability $1-\delta$ by making as few sequentially chosen noisy measurements of the form $x^\top\theta^{\ast}$ as possible. When $\mathcal{X}=\mathcal{Z}$, this setting generalizes linear bandits, and when $\mathcal{X}$ is the standard basis vectors and $\mathcal{Z}\subset \{0,1\}^d$, combinatorial bandits. The transductive setting naturally arises when the set of measurement vectors is limited due to factors such as availability or cost. As an example, in drug discovery the compounds and dosages $\mathcal{X}$ a practitioner may be willing to evaluate in the lab in vitro due to cost or safety reasons may differ vastly from those compounds and dosages $\mathcal{Z}$ that can be safely administered to patients in vivo. Alternatively, in recommender systems for books, the set of books $\mathcal{X}$ a user is queried about may be restricted to known best-sellers even though the goal might be to recommend more esoteric titles $\mathcal{Z}$. In this paper, we provide instance-dependent lower bounds for the transductive setting, an algorithm that matches these up to logarithmic factors, and an evaluation. In particular, we present the first non-asymptotic algorithm for linear bandits that nearly achieves the information-theoretic lower bound.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/8ba6c657b03fc7c8dd4dff8e45defcd2-Paper.pdf,2019,"mathcal, set, ast, bandits, linear, mathbb, may, setting, subset, theta","algorithm, allocation, optimal, linear, arms, problem, rd, set, sample, log","{'experimental': 0.478905150891956, 'transductive': 0.478905150891956, 'design': 0.42226993542468605, 'sequential': 0.39842901330490726, 'bandits': 0.32960703195977353, 'linear': 0.30919466420733077}","{'mathcal': 0.5822470821322804, 'ast': 0.22903281399389738, 'transductive': 0.20194744490680241, 'theta': 0.18215876583306626, 'mathbb': 0.1735832348074457, 'books': 0.1613294804158065, 'compounds': 0.1613294804158065, 'dosages': 0.1613294804158065, 'bandits': 0.161254854052343, 'vectors': 0.15237986639142867}"
End to end learning and optimization on graphs,"Bryan Wilder, Eric Ewing, Bistra Dilkina, Milind Tambe","Real-world applications often combine learning and optimization problems on graphs. For instance, our objective may be to cluster the graph in order to detect meaningful communities (or solve other common graph optimization problems such as facility location, maxcut, and so on). However, graphs or related attributes are often only partially observed, introducing learning problems such as link prediction which must be solved prior to optimization. Standard approaches treat learning and optimization entirely separately, while recent machine learning work aims to predict the optimal solution directly from the inputs. Here, we propose an alternative decision-focused learning approach that integrates a differentiable proxy for common graph optimization problems as a layer in learned systems. The main idea is to learn a representation that maps the original optimization problem onto a simpler proxy problem that can be efficiently differentiated through. Experimental results show that our ClusterNet system outperforms both pure end-to-end approaches (that directly predict the optimal solution) and standard approaches that entirely separate learning and optimization.

Efficient Meta Learning via Minibatch Proximal Update,"Pan Zhou, Xiaotong Yuan, Huan Xu, Shuicheng Yan, Jiashi Feng","We address the problem of meta-learning which learns a prior over hypothesis from a sample of meta-training tasks for fast adaptation on meta-testing tasks. A particularly simple yet successful paradigm for this research is model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML). Implementation and analysis of MAML, however, can be tricky; first-order approximation is usually adopted to avoid directly computing Hessian matrix but as a result the convergence and generalization guarantees remain largely mysterious for MAML. To remedy this deficiency, in this paper we propose a minibatch proximal update based meta-learning approach for learning to efficient hypothesis transfer. The principle is to learn a prior hypothesis shared across tasks such that the minibatch risk minimization biased regularized by this prior can quickly converge to the optimal hypothesis in each training task. The prior hypothesis training model can be efficiently optimized via SGD with provable convergence guarantees for both convex and non-convex problems. Moreover, we theoretically justify the benefit of the learnt prior hypothesis for fast adaptation to new few-shot learning tasks via minibatch proximal update.

Triad Constraints for Learning Causal Structure of Latent Variables,"Ruichu Cai, Feng Xie, Clark Glymour, Zhifeng Hao, Kun Zhang","Learning causal structure from observational data has attracted much attention, and it is notoriously challenging to find the underlying structure in the presence of confounders (hidden direct common causes of two variables). In this paper, by properly leveraging the non-Gaussianity of the data, we propose to estimate the structure over latent variables with the so-called Triad constraints: we design a form of ""pseudo-residual"" from three variables, and show that when causal relations are linear and noise terms are non-Gaussian, the causal direction between the latent variables for the three observed variables is identifiable by checking a certain kind of independence relationship. In other words, the Triad constraints help us to locate latent confounders and determine the causal direction between them. This goes far beyond the Tetrad constraints and reveals more information about the underlying structure from non-Gaussian data. Finally, based on the Triad constraints, we develop a two-step algorithm to learn the causal structure corresponding to measurement models.

Beyond temperature scaling: Obtaining well-calibrated multi-class probabilities with Dirichlet calibration,"Meelis Kull, Miquel Perello Nieto, Markus Kängsepp, Telmo Silva Filho, Hao Song, Peter Flach","Class probabilities predicted by most multiclass classifiers are uncalibrated, often tending towards over-confidence. With neural networks, calibration can be improved by temperature scaling, a method to learn a single corrective multiplicative factor for inputs to the last softmax layer. On non-neural models the existing methods apply binary calibration in a pairwise or one-vs-rest fashion. We propose a natively multiclass calibration method applicable to classifiers from any model class, derived from Dirichlet distributions and generalising the beta calibration method from binary classification. It is easily implemented with neural nets since it is equivalent to log-transforming the uncalibrated probabilities, followed by one linear layer and softmax.

Curvilinear Distance Metric Learning,"Shuo Chen, Lei Luo, Jian Yang, Chen Gong, Jun Li, Heng Huang","Distance Metric Learning aims to learn an appropriate metric that faithfully measures the distance between two data points. Traditional metric learning methods usually calculate the pairwise distance with fixed distance functions (\emph{e.g.,}\ Euclidean distance) in the projected feature spaces. However, they fail to learn the underlying geometries of the sample space, and thus cannot exactly predict the intrinsic distances between data points. To address this issue, we first reveal that the traditional linear distance metric is equivalent to the cumulative arc length between the data pair's nearest points on the learned straight measurer lines. After that, by extending such straight lines to general curved forms, we propose a Curvilinear Distance Metric Learning (CDML) method, which adaptively learns the nonlinear geometries of the training data. By virtue of Weierstrass theorem, the proposed CDML is equivalently parameterized with a 3-order tensor, and the optimization algorithm is designed to learn the tensor parameter. Theoretical analysis is derived to guarantee the effectiveness and soundness of CDML.

Sampling Networks and Aggregate Simulation for Online POMDP Planning,"Hao(Jackson) Cui, Roni Khardon","The paper introduces a new algorithm for planning in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP) based on the idea of aggregate simulation. The algorithm uses product distributions to approximate the belief state and shows how to build a representation graph of an approximate action-value function over belief space. The graph captures the result of simulating the model in aggregate under independence assumptions, giving a symbolic representation of the value function. The algorithm supports large observation spaces using sampling networks, a representation of the process of sampling values of observations, which is integrated into the graph representation. Following previous work in MDPs this approach enables action selection in POMDPs through gradient optimization over the graph representation. This approach complements recent algorithms for POMDPs which are based on particle representations of belief states and an explicit search for action selection.

The Parameterized Complexity of Cascading Portfolio Scheduling,"Eduard Eiben, Robert Ganian, Iyad Kanj, Stefan Szeider","Cascading portfolio scheduling is a static algorithm selection strategy which uses a sample of test instances to compute an optimal ordering (a cascading schedule) of a portfolio of available algorithms.  The algorithms are then applied to each future instance according to this cascading schedule, until some algorithm in the schedule succeeds. Cascading algorithm scheduling has proven to be effective in several applications, including QBF solving and the generation of ImageNet classification models.It is known that the computation of an optimal cascading schedule in
the offline phase is NP-hard. In this paper we study the parameterized complexity of this problem and establish its fixed-parameter tractability by utilizing structural properties of the success relation between algorithms and test instances.Our findings are significant as they reveal that in spite of the intractability of the problem in its general form, one can indeed exploit sparseness or density of the success relation to obtain non-trivial runtime guarantees for finding an optimal cascading schedule.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/8ce1a43fb75e779c6b794ba4d255cf6d-Paper.pdf,2019,"cascading, schedule, algorithm, algorithms, optimal, instances, portfolio, problem, relation, scheduling","algorithm, algorithms, xi, test, cost, number, success, failure, instance, portfolio","{'cascading': 0.4991282888883178, 'portfolio': 0.4723945731158921, 'scheduling': 0.4723945731158921, 'parameterized': 0.4165292971125787, 'complexity': 0.3620235219700913}","{'cascading': 0.6359976073155867, 'schedule': 0.4246956533526768, 'portfolio': 0.1925879596216292, 'scheduling': 0.18633893520218867, 'relation': 0.15750495437325018, 'instances': 0.12954165000648646, 'optimal': 0.11886263555027815, 'success': 0.1181868008662072, 'intractability': 0.10599960121926447, 'qbf': 0.10599960121926447}"
Non-Asymptotic Pure Exploration by Solving Games,"Rémy Degenne, Wouter M.

The existing state of the art algorithms achieve asymptotic optimality by solving a plug-in estimate of that optimisation problem at each step. We interpret the optimisation problem as an unknown game, and propose sampling rules based on iterative strategies to estimate and converge to its saddle point.

Perceiving the arrow of time in autoregressive motion,"Kristof Meding, Dominik Janzing, Bernhard Schölkopf, Felix A. Wichmann","Understanding the principles of causal inference in the visual system has a long history at least since the seminal studies by Albert Michotte. Many cognitive and machine learning scientists believe that intelligent behavior requires agents to possess causal models of the world. Recent ML algorithms exploit the dependence structure of additive noise terms for inferring causal structures from observational data, e.g. to detect the direction of time series; the arrow of time. This raises the question whether the subtle asymmetries between the time directions can also be perceived by humans. Here we show that human observers can indeed discriminate forward and backward autoregressive motion with non-Gaussian additive independent noise, i.e. they appear sensitive to subtle asymmetries between the time directions. We employ a so-called frozen noise paradigm enabling us to compare human performance with four different algorithms on a trial-by-trial basis: A causal inference algorithm exploiting the dependence structure of additive noise terms, a neurally inspired network, a Bayesian ideal observer model as well as a simple heuristic. Our results suggest that all human observers use similar cues or strategies to solve the arrow of time motion discrimination task, but the human algorithm is significantly different from the three machine algorithms we compared it to. In fact, our simple heuristic appears most similar to our human observers.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/8d3369c4c086f236fabf61d614a32818-Paper.pdf,2019,"human, time, causal, noise, additive, algorithms, observers, algorithm, arrow, asymmetries","time, noise, observers, human, series, causal, observer, experiment, algorithms, gaussian","{'arrow': 0.5057371198276073, 'perceiving': 0.5057371198276073, 'autoregressive': 0.45943040771938737, 'motion': 0.4323427176043884, 'time': 0.3007713521168566}","{'observers': 0.27492752996602654, 'human': 0.2647462853986377, 'causal': 0.2563063572606282, 'additive': 0.2156322691893519, 'arrow': 0.20852474021044995, 'asymmetries': 0.20852474021044995, 'noise': 0.2026449205910867, 'subtle': 0.1973559860836879, 'time': 0.1746718878226488, 'trial': 0.1740167115430245}"

Noise-tolerant fair classification,"Alex Lamy, Ziyuan Zhong, Aditya K.

Existing work on the problem operates under the assumption that the sensitive feature available in one's training sample is perfectly reliable. This assumption may be violated in many real-world cases: for example, respondents to a survey may choose to conceal or obfuscate their group identity out of fear of potential discrimination. This poses the question of whether one can still learn fair classifiers given noisy sensitive features. In this paper, we answer the question in the affirmative: we show that if one measures fairness using the mean-difference score, and sensitive features are subject to noise from the mutually contaminated learning model, then owing to a simple identity we only need to change the desired fairness-tolerance. The requisite tolerance can be estimated by leveraging existing noise-rate estimators from the label noise literature.

Selecting Optimal Decisions via Distributionally Robust Nearest-Neighbor Regression,"Ruidi Chen, Ioannis Paschalidis","This paper develops a prediction-based prescriptive model for optimal decision
making that (i) predicts the outcome under each action using a robust

Optimization (DRO) with an ambiguity set constructed from the Wasserstein

capture the nonlinearity embedded in the data. We show theoretical results

Exploiting Local and Global Structure for Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation with Contextual Point Representations,"Xu Wang, Jingming He, Lin Ma","In this paper, we propose one novel model for point cloud semantic segmentation,which exploits both the local and global structures within the point cloud based onthe contextual point representations.

Heterogeneous Graph Learning for Visual Commonsense Reasoning,"Weijiang Yu, Jingwen Zhou, Weihao Yu, Xiaodan Liang, Nong Xiao","Visual commonsense reasoning task aims at leading the research field into solving cognition-level reasoning with the ability to predict correct answers and meanwhile providing convincing reasoning paths, resulting in three sub-tasks i.e., Q->A, QA->R and Q->AR. It poses great challenges over the proper semantic alignment between vision and linguistic domains and knowledge reasoning to generate persuasive reasoning paths. Existing works either resort to a powerful end-to-end network that cannot produce interpretable reasoning paths or solely explore intra-relationship of visual objects (homogeneous graph) while ignoring the cross-domain semantic alignment among visual concepts and linguistic words. In this paper, we propose a new Heterogeneous Graph Learning (HGL) framework for seamlessly integrating the intra-graph and inter-graph reasoning in order to bridge the vision and language domain. Our HGL consists of a primal vision-to-answer heterogeneous graph (VAHG) module and a dual question-to-answer heterogeneous graph (QAHG) module to interactively refine reasoning paths for semantic agreement. Moreover, our HGL integrates a contextual voting module to exploit a long-range visual context for better global reasoning. Experiments on the large-scale Visual Commonsense Reasoning benchmark demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed modules on three tasks (improving 5% accuracy on Q->A, 3.5% on QA->R, 5.8% on Q->AR).",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/8f19793b2671094e63a15ab883d50137-Paper.pdf,2019,"reasoning, graph, visual, paths, heterogeneous, hgl, module, semantic, vision, alignment","graph, answer, heterogeneous, visual, vision, module, reasoning, representation, question, hgl","{'commonsense': 0.5360077039312836, 'heterogeneous': 0.4841518927823246, 'reasoning': 0.43229608163336564, 'visual': 0.40196237666674656, 'graph': 0.31314799302241786, 'learning': 0.17826207127848775}","{'reasoning': 0.5375152207283298, 'paths': 0.2644932925984243, 'hgl': 0.24755536687811355, 'visual': 0.22370173507531177, 'graph': 0.22060219273403173, 'heterogeneous': 0.17393503186004516, 'module': 0.16768726311405968, 'qa': 0.15619740049783903, 'ar': 0.1499256678076855, 'vision': 0.14573913839550015}"

Adapting Neural Networks for the Estimation of Treatment Effects,"Claudia Shi, David Blei, Victor Veitch","This paper addresses the use of neural networks for the estimation of treatment effects from observational data. Generally, estimation proceeds in two stages. First, we ﬁt models for the expected outcome and the probability of treatment (propensity score). Second, we plug these ﬁtted models into a downstream estimator. Neural networks are a natural choice for the models in the ﬁrst step. Our question is: how can we adapt the design and training of the neural networks used in this ﬁrst step in order to improve the quality of the ﬁnal estimate of the treatment effect? We propose two adaptations based on insights from the statistical literature on the estimation of treatment effects. The ﬁrst is a new architecture, the Dragonnet, that exploits the sufﬁciency of the propensity score for estimation adjustment. The second is a regularization procedure, targeted regularization, that induces a bias towards models that have non-parametrically optimal asymptotic properties ‘out-of-the-box’.

Solving graph compression via optimal transport,"Vikas Garg, Tommi Jaakkola","We propose a new approach to graph compression by appeal to optimal transport.

The transport formulation can be setup for either directed or undirected graphs, and its dual characterization is cast in terms of distributions over the nodes. The compression pertains to the support of node distributions and makes the problem challenging to solve directly. To this end, we introduce Boolean relaxations and specify conditions under which these relaxations are exact. The relaxations admit algorithms with provably fast convergence.

Optimal Sampling and Clustering in the Stochastic Block Model,"Se-Young Yun, Alexandre Proutiere","This paper investigates the design of joint adaptive sampling and clustering algorithms in networks whose structure follows the celebrated Stochastic Block Model (SBM). To extract hidden clusters, the interaction between edges (pairs of nodes) may be sampled sequentially, in an adaptive manner. After gathering samples, the learner returns cluster estimates. We derive information-theoretical upper bounds on the cluster recovery rate. These bounds actually reveal the optimal sequential edge sampling strategy, and interestingly, the latter does not depend on the sampling budget, but on the parameters of the SBM only. We devise a joint sampling and clustering algorithm matching the recovery rate upper bounds. The algorithm initially uses a fraction of the sampling budget to estimate the SBM parameters, and to learn the optimal sampling strategy. This strategy then guides the remaining sampling process, which confers the optimality of the algorithm. We show both analytically and numerically that adaptive edge sampling yields important improvements over random sampling (traditionally used in the SBM analysis). For example, we prove that adaptive sampling significantly enlarges the region of the SBM parameters where asymptotically exact cluster recovery is feasible.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/8fe04df45a22b63156ebabbb064fcd5e-Paper.pdf,2019,"sampling, sbm, adaptive, algorithm, bounds, cluster, parameters, recovery, strategy, budget","sampling, nodes, algorithm, cluster, log, sbm, adaptive, mis, pt, recovery","{'block': 0.5006976081585632, 'clustering': 0.43902237152775303, 'sampling': 0.4100179147490709, 'stochastic': 0.364264988001525, 'model': 0.3608253147226728, 'optimal': 0.3543482507912206}","{'sbm': 0.4750667799325575, 'sampling': 0.4642982213757424, 'cluster': 0.21160596844724477, 'recovery': 0.2095653235135909, 'adaptive': 0.20791170431752828, 'strategy': 0.16029802394315543, 'budget': 0.1532586236897472, 'edge': 0.13841617516467156, 'bounds': 0.12861689114411026, 'clustering': 0.12486776715065162}"

Incremental Scene Synthesis,"Benjamin Planche, Xuejian Rong, Ziyan Wu, Srikrishna Karanam, Harald Kosch, YingLi Tian, Jan Ernst, ANDREAS HUTTER","We present a method to incrementally generate complete 2D or 3D scenes with the following properties: (a) it is globally consistent at each step according to a learned scene prior, (b) real observations of a scene can be incorporated while observing global consistency, (c) unobserved regions can be hallucinated locally in consistence with previous observations, hallucinations and global priors, and (d) hallucinations are statistical in nature, i.e., different scenes can be generated from the same observations. To achieve this, we model the virtual scene, where an active agent at each step can either perceive an observed part of the scene or generate a local hallucination. The latter can be interpreted as the agent's expectation at this step through the scene and can  be applied to autonomous navigation. In the limit of observing real data at each point, our method converges to solving the SLAM problem. It can otherwise sample entirely imagined scenes from prior distributions.

In particular, ExactLine computes a partitioning of the given input line segment such that the network is affine on each partition. We present an efficient algorithm for computing ExactLine for networks that use ReLU, MaxPool, batch normalization, fully-connected, convolutional, and other layers, along with several applications. First, we show how to exactly determine decision boundaries of an ACAS Xu neural network, providing significantly improved confidence in the results compared to prior work that sampled finitely many points in the input space. Next, we demonstrate how to exactly compute integrated gradients, which are commonly used for neural network attributions, allowing us to show that the prior heuristic-based methods had relative errors of 25-45% and show that a better sampling method can achieve higher accuracy with less computation.

Markov Random Fields for Collaborative Filtering,Harald Steck,"In this paper, we model the dependencies among the items that are recommended to a user in a collaborative-filtering problem via a Gaussian Markov Random Field (MRF). We build upon Besag's auto-normal parameterization and pseudo-likelihood, which not only enables computationally efficient learning, but also connects the areas of MRFs and sparse inverse covariance estimation with autoencoders and neighborhood models, two successful approaches in collaborative filtering. We propose a novel approximation for learning sparse MRFs, where the trade-off between recommendation-accuracy and training-time can be controlled. At only a small fraction of the training-time compared to various baselines, including deep nonlinear models, the proposed approach achieved competitive ranking-accuracy on all three well-known data-sets used in our experiments, and notably a 20% gain in accuracy on the data-set with the largest number of items.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/9087b0efc7c7acd1ef7e153678809c77-Paper.pdf,2019,"accuracy, collaborative, data, filtering, items, learning, models, mrfs, sparse, time","data, matrix, training, section, accuracy, items, model, sparse, time, approximation","{'fields': 0.5122326518589202, 'collaborative': 0.48479705578270516, 'filtering': 0.48479705578270516, 'markov': 0.3715282680271785, 'random': 0.35990010535584005}","{'mrfs': 0.308371813259667, 'collaborative': 0.2785385284117586, 'filtering': 0.24526017884311738, 'items': 0.2267191390699817, 'accuracy': 0.20041349639758835, 'sparse': 0.16444326551753613, 'besag': 0.16291158308451303, 'mrf': 0.16291158308451303, 'recommended': 0.16291158308451303, 'connects': 0.1392692642058793}"
Limiting Extrapolation in Linear Approximate Value Iteration,"Andrea Zanette, Alessandro Lazaric, Mykel J. Kochenderfer, Emma Brunskill","We study linear approximate value iteration (LAVI) with a generative model. While linear models may accurately represent the optimal value function using a few parameters, several empirical and theoretical studies show the combination of least-squares projection with the Bellman operator may be expansive, thus leading LAVI to amplify errors over iterations and eventually diverge. We introduce an algorithm that approximates value functions by combining Q-values estimated at a set of \textit{anchor} states. Our algorithm tries to balance the generalization and compactness of linear methods with the small amplification of errors typical of interpolation methods. We prove that if the features at any state can be represented as a convex combination of features at the anchor points, then errors are propagated linearly over iterations (instead of exponentially) and our method achieves a polynomial sample complexity bound in the horizon and the number of anchor points.

"Lookahead Optimizer: k steps forward, 1 step back","Michael Zhang, James Lucas, Jimmy Ba, Geoffrey E.

Recent attempts to improve SGD can be broadly categorized into two approaches: (1) adaptive learning rate schemes, such as AdaGrad and Adam and (2) accelerated schemes, such as heavy-ball and Nesterov momentum. In this paper, we propose a new optimization algorithm, Lookahead, that is orthogonal to these previous approaches and iteratively updates two sets of weights. Intuitively, the algorithm chooses a search direction by looking ahead at the sequence of ``fast weights"" generated by another optimizer. We show that Lookahead improves the learning stability and lowers the variance of its inner optimizer with negligible computation and memory cost.

Yet none of these games address the real-life challenge of cooperation in the presence of unknown and uncertain teammates. This challenge is a key game mechanism in hidden role games. Here we develop the DeepRole algorithm, a multi-agent reinforcement learning agent that we test on ""The Resistance: Avalon"", the most popular hidden role game. DeepRole combines counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) with deep value networks trained through self-play. Our algorithm integrates deductive reasoning into vector-form CFR to reason about joint beliefs and deduce partially observable actions. We augment deep value networks with constraints that yield interpretable representations of win probabilities. These innovations enable DeepRole to scale to the full Avalon game. Empirical game-theoretic methods show that DeepRole outperforms other hand-crafted and learned agents in five-player Avalon.

Layer-Dependent Importance Sampling for Training Deep and Large Graph Convolutional Networks,"Difan Zou, Ziniu Hu, Yewen Wang, Song Jiang, Yizhou Sun, Quanquan Gu","Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have recently received wide attentions, due to their successful applications in different graph tasks and different domains. Training GCNs for a large graph, however, is still a challenge. Original full-batch GCN training requires calculating the representation of all the nodes in the graph per GCN layer, which brings in high computation and memory costs. To alleviate this issue, several sampling-based methods are proposed to train GCNs on a subset of nodes. Among them, the node-wise neighbor-sampling method recursively samples a fixed number of neighbor nodes, and thus its computation cost suffers from exponential growing neighbor size across layers; while the layer-wise importance-sampling method discards the neighbor-dependent constraints, and thus the nodes sampled across layer suffer from sparse connection problem. To deal with the above two problems, we propose a new effective sampling algorithm called LAyer-Dependent ImportancE Sampling (LADIES). Based on the sampled nodes in the upper layer, LADIES selects nodes that are in the neighborhood of these nodes and uses the constructed bipartite graph to compute the importance probability. Then, it samples a fixed number of nodes according to the probability for the whole layer, and recursively conducts such procedure per layer to construct the whole computation graph. We prove theoretically and experimentally, that our proposed sampling algorithm outperforms the previous sampling methods regarding both time and memory. Furthermore, LADIES is shown to have better generalization accuracy than original full-batch GCN, due to its stochastic nature.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/91ba4a4478a66bee9812b0804b6f9d1b-Paper.pdf,2019,"nodes, layer, sampling, graph, neighbor, computation, gcn, gcns, importance, ladies","sampling, layer, nodes, ladies, gcn, batch, sampled, training, graph, node","{'dependent': 0.3849050935576542, 'importance': 0.3849050935576542, 'layer': 0.3849050935576542, 'large': 0.33798791094396186, 'convolutional': 0.3278722097869404, 'sampling': 0.3091927342177951, 'training': 0.2847284987248245, 'graph': 0.26053717474077004, 'deep': 0.22119991177033682, 'networks': 0.2008200878821881}","{'nodes': 0.4048406480852813, 'layer': 0.2997411117642021, 'sampling': 0.27966653051296536, 'ladies': 0.2591544273660326, 'neighbor': 0.25062360550805807, 'graph': 0.23093837816825605, 'gcns': 0.2215449984071416, 'gcn': 0.2076644771932469, 'importance': 0.14569798382816374, 'computation': 0.1374421438589689}"
Self-Supervised Generalisation with Meta Auxiliary Learning,"Shikun Liu, Andrew Davison, Edward Johns","Learning with auxiliary tasks can improve the ability of a primary task to generalise. However, this comes at the cost of manually labelling auxiliary data. We propose a new method which automatically learns appropriate labels for an auxiliary task, such that any supervised learning task can be improved without requiring access to any further data. The approach is to train two neural networks: a label-generation network to predict the auxiliary labels, and a multi-task network to train the primary task alongside the auxiliary task. The loss for the label-generation network incorporates the loss of the multi-task network, and so this interaction between the two networks can be seen as a form of meta learning with a double gradient. We show that our proposed method, Meta AuXiliary Learning (MAXL), outperforms single-task learning on 7 image datasets, without requiring any additional data. We also show that MAXL outperforms several other baselines for generating auxiliary labels, and is even competitive when compared with human-defined auxiliary labels.

On Robustness of Principal Component Regression,"Anish Agarwal, Devavrat Shah, Dennis Shen, Dogyoon Song","Consider the setting of Linear Regression where the observed response variables, in expectation, are linear functions of the p-dimensional covariates. Then to achieve vanishing prediction error, the number of required samples scales faster than pσ2, where σ2 is a bound on the noise variance. In a high-dimensional setting where p is large but the covariates admit a low-dimensional representation (say r ≪ p), then Principal Component Regression (PCR), cf. [36], is an effective approach; here, the response variables are regressed with respect to the principal components of the covariates. The resulting number of required samples to achieve vanishing prediction error now scales faster than rσ2(≪ pσ2). Despite the tremendous utility of PCR, its ability to handle settings with noisy, missing, and mixed (discrete and continuous) valued covariates is not understood and remains an important open challenge, cf. [24]. As the main contribution of this work, we address this challenge by rigorously establishing that PCR is robust to noisy, sparse, and possibly mixed valued covariates. Specifically, under PCR, vanishing prediction error is achieved with the number of samples scaling as r max(σ2, ρ−4 log5(p)), where ρ denotes the fraction of observed (noisy) covariates. We establish generalization error bounds on the performance of PCR, which provides a systematic approach in selecting the correct number of components r in a data-driven manner. The key to our result is a simple, but powerful equivalence between (i) PCR and (ii) Linear Regression with covariate pre-processing via Hard Singular Value Thresholding (HSVT). From a technical standpoint, this work advances the state-of-the-art analysis for HSVT by establishing stronger guarantees with respect to the ∥·∥2,∞-error for the estimated matrix rather than the Frobenius norm/mean-squared error (MSE) as is commonly done in the matrix estimation / completion literature.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/923e325e16617477e457f6a468a2d6df-Paper.pdf,2019,"covariates, error, pcr, number, dimensional, linear, noisy, prediction, regression, samples","error, pcr, covariates, matrix, regression, let, model, prediction, linear, covariate","{'component': 0.5629850625818239, 'principal': 0.5629850625818239, 'robustness': 0.43542314985742814, 'regression': 0.4201217908984434}","{'pcr': 0.45123308653746075, 'covariates': 0.39787036317895613, 'error': 0.20698943626705574, 'vanishing': 0.17493543447620832, 'cf': 0.15892307771987835, 'hsvt': 0.15892307771987835, 'pσ2': 0.15892307771987835, 'σ2': 0.15892307771987835, 'noisy': 0.13024855382271092, 'regression': 0.11851303017690801}"

One-Shot Object Detection with Co-Attention and Co-Excitation,"Ting-I Hsieh, Yi-Chen Lo, Hwann-Tzong Chen, Tyng-Luh Liu","This paper aims to tackle the challenging problem of one-shot object detection. Given a query image patch whose class label is not included in the training data, the goal of the task is to detect all instances of the same class in a target image. To this end, we develop a novel {\em co-attention and co-excitation} (CoAE) framework that makes contributions in three key technical aspects. First, we propose to use the non-local operation to explore the co-attention embodied in each query-target pair and yield region proposals accounting for the one-shot situation. Second, we formulate a squeeze-and-co-excitation scheme that can adaptively emphasize correlated feature channels to help uncover relevant proposals and eventually the target objects. Third, we design a margin-based ranking loss for implicitly learning a metric to predict the similarity of a region proposal to the underlying query, no matter its class label is seen or unseen in training. The resulting model is therefore a two-stage detector that yields a strong baseline on both VOC and MS-COCO under one-shot setting of detecting objects from both seen and never-seen classes.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/92af93f73faf3cefc129b6bc55a748a9-Paper.pdf,2019,"co, class, one, query, seen, shot, target, attention, excitation, image","object, query, co, image, shot, classes, class, target, one, excitation","{'co': 0.6570623595655906, 'excitation': 0.40218078605033036, 'one': 0.2988004937189458, 'shot': 0.28848557473846403, 'attention': 0.2854489219234094, 'object': 0.2798514379315718, 'detection': 0.272426310688898}","{'co': 0.33998517164312586, 'excitation': 0.23950958135616504, 'query': 0.23402045853713177, 'seen': 0.22622299354373704, 'shot': 0.21829497049774138, 'proposals': 0.20475108358886399, 'target': 0.17967497325592074, 'region': 0.15279338235239284, 'class': 0.15220121330323041, 'label': 0.1424408409135398}"

Are Anchor Points Really Indispensable in Label-Noise Learning?,"Xiaobo Xia, Tongliang Liu, Nannan Wang, Bo Han, Chen Gong, Gang Niu, Masashi Sugiyama","In label-noise learning, the \textit{noise transition matrix}, denoting the probabilities that clean labels flip into noisy labels, plays a central role in building \textit{statistically consistent classifiers}. Existing theories have shown that the transition matrix can be learned by exploiting \textit{anchor points} (i.e., data points that belong to a specific class almost surely). However, when there are no anchor points, the transition matrix will be poorly learned, and those previously consistent classifiers will significantly degenerate. In this paper, without employing anchor points, we propose a \textit{transition-revision} ($T$-Revision) method to effectively learn transition matrices, leading to better classifiers. Specifically, to learn a transition matrix, we first initialize it by exploiting data points that are similar to anchor points, having high \textit{noisy class posterior probabilities}. Then, we modify the initialized matrix by adding a \textit{slack variable}, which can be learned and validated together with the classifier by using noisy data. Empirical results on benchmark-simulated and real-world label-noise datasets demonstrate that without using exact anchor points, the proposed method is superior to state-of-the-art label-noise learning methods.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/9308b0d6e5898366a4a986bc33f3d3e7-Paper.pdf,2019,"points, textit, transition, anchor, matrix, noise, classifiers, data, label, learned","transition, matrix, consistent, anchor, noisy, risk, points, data, class, learning","{'indispensable': 0.4646527084322152, 'anchor': 0.43976553269673196, 'really': 0.43976553269673196, 'points': 0.3658664914159495, 'label': 0.3546757168374188, 'noise': 0.34097931568046624, 'learning': 0.14625445522599623}","{'textit': 0.3895442963025239, 'anchor': 0.3774123986728437, 'transition': 0.3755518150088526, 'points': 0.31342724224986973, 'matrix': 0.2283521243418923, 'noise': 0.17959697342230055, 'revision': 0.17490957919901118, 'classifiers': 0.16572488133073549, 'label': 0.16486321940923618, 'noisy': 0.15146309359909152}"
SCAN: A Scalable Neural Networks Framework Towards Compact and Efficient Models,"Linfeng Zhang, Zhanhong Tan, Jiebo Song, Jingwei Chen, Chenglong Bao, Kaisheng Ma","Remarkable achievements have been attained by deep neural networks in various applications. However, the increasing depth and width of such models also lead to explosive growth in both storage and computation, which has restricted the deployment of deep neural networks on resource-limited edge devices. To address this problem, we propose the so-called SCAN framework for networks training and inference, which is orthogonal and complementary to existing acceleration and compression methods. The proposed SCAN firstly divides neural networks into multiple sections according to their depth and constructs shallow classifiers upon the intermediate features of different sections. Moreover, attention modules and knowledge distillation are utilized to enhance the accuracy of shallow classifiers. Based on this architecture, we further propose a threshold controlled scalable inference mechanism to approach human-like sample-specific inference. Experimental results show that SCAN can be easily equipped on various neural networks without any adjustment on hyper-parameters or neural networks architectures, yielding significant performance gain on CIFAR100 and ImageNet.

Multi-Resolution Weak Supervision for Sequential Data,"Paroma Varma, Frederic Sala, Shiori Sagawa, Jason Fries, Daniel Fu, Saelig Khattar, Ashwini Ramamoorthy, Ke Xiao, Kayvon Fatahalian, James Priest, Christopher Ré","Since manually labeling training data is slow and expensive, recent industrial and scientific research efforts have turned to weaker or noisier forms of supervision sources. However, existing weak supervision approaches fail to model multi-resolution sources for sequential data, like video, that can assign labels to individual elements or collections of elements in a sequence. A key challenge in weak supervision is estimating the unknown accuracies and correlations of these sources without using labeled data. Multi-resolution sources exacerbate this challenge due to complex correlations and sample complexity that scales in the length of the sequence. We propose Dugong, the first framework to model multi-resolution weak supervision sources with complex correlations to assign probabilistic labels to training data. Theoretically, we prove that Dugong, under mild conditions, can uniquely recover the unobserved accuracy and correlation parameters and use parameter sharing to improve sample complexity. Our method assigns clinician-validated labels to population-scale biomedical video repositories, helping outperform traditional supervision by 36.8 F1 points and addressing a key use case where machine learning has been severely limited by the lack of expert labeled data. On average, Dugong improves over traditional supervision by 16.0 F1 points and existing weak supervision approaches by 24.2 F1 points across several video and sensor classification tasks.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/93db85ed909c13838ff95ccfa94cebd9-Paper.pdf,2019,"supervision, data, sources, weak, correlations, dugong, f1, labels, multi, points","sources, labels, supervision, model, data, label, end, weak, set, training","{'weak': 0.5170206497840361, 'supervision': 0.4544407537864957, 'resolution': 0.43146071389157375, 'sequential': 0.4071008899621531, 'data': 0.2971811301402702, 'multi': 0.29320153929269027}","{'supervision': 0.40906662296061225, 'sources': 0.3315335708591134, 'dugong': 0.27106859193813987, 'weak': 0.24694157820029722, 'f1': 0.2172114827459108, 'correlations': 0.18520618365022293, 'resolution': 0.18361448136435943, 'video': 0.17068753012359955, 'labels': 0.14928053823750348, 'assign': 0.14229253069472764}"

Dimensionality reduction: theoretical perspective on practical measures,"Yair Bartal, Nova Fandina, Ofer Neiman","Dimensionality reduction plays a central role in real-world applications for Machine Learning, among many fields. In particular,  metric dimensionality reduction where data from a general metric is mapped into low dimensional space, is often used as a first step before applying machine learning algorithms. In almost all these applications the quality of the embedding is measured by various average case criteria. Metric dimensionality reduction has also been studied in Math and TCS, within the extremely fruitful and influential field of metric embedding. Yet, the vast majority of theoretical research has been devoted to analyzing the worst case behavior of embeddings and therefore has little relevance to practical settings. The goal of this paper is to bridge the gap between theory and practice view-points of metric dimensionality reduction, laying the foundation for a theoretical study of more practically oriented analysis. This paper can be viewed as providing a comprehensive theoretical framework addressing a line of research initiated by VL [NeuroIPS' 18] who have set the goal of analyzing different distortion measurement criteria, with the lens of Machine Learning applicability, from both theoretical and practical perspectives.
We complement their work by considering some important and vastly used average case criteria, some of which originated within the well-known Multi-Dimensional Scaling framework.  While often studied in practice, no theoretical studies have thus far attempted at providing rigorous analysis of these criteria. In this paper we provide the first analysis of these, as well as the new distortion measure developed by [VL18] designed to possess Machine Learning desired properties. Moreover, we show that all measures considered can be adapted to possess similar qualities.

MCP: Learning Composable Hierarchical Control with Multiplicative Compositional Policies,"Xue Bin Peng, Michael Chang, Grace Zhang, Pieter Abbeel, Sergey Levine","Humans are able to perform a myriad of sophisticated tasks by drawing upon skills acquired through prior experience. For autonomous agents to have this capability, they must be able to extract reusable skills from past experience that can be recombined in new ways for subsequent tasks. Furthermore, when controlling complex high-dimensional morphologies, such as humanoid bodies, tasks often require coordination of multiple skills simultaneously. Learning discrete primitives for every combination of skills quickly becomes prohibitive. Composable primitives that can be recombined to create a large variety of behaviors can be more suitable for modeling this combinatorial explosion. In this work, we propose multiplicative compositional policies (MCP), a method for learning reusable motor skills that can be composed to produce a range of complex behaviors. Our method factorizes an agent's skills into a collection of primitives, where multiple primitives can be activated simultaneously via multiplicative composition. This flexibility allows the primitives to be transferred and recombined to elicit new behaviors as necessary for novel tasks. We demonstrate that MCP is able to extract composable skills for highly complex simulated characters from pre-training tasks, such as motion imitation, and then reuse these skills to solve challenging continuous control tasks, such as dribbling a soccer ball to a goal, and picking up an object and transporting it to a target location.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/95192c98732387165bf8e396c0f2dad2-Paper.pdf,2019,"skills, tasks, primitives, able, behaviors, complex, recombined, composable, experience, extract","tasks, primitives, model, primitive, skills, pre, training, mcp, transfer, space","{'mcp': 0.4266485035887763, 'multiplicative': 0.4266485035887763, 'composable': 0.4037968638729092, 'policies': 0.37500720262092424, 'compositional': 0.35604393754113645, 'hierarchical': 0.30945309522826575, 'control': 0.30281495191670166, 'learning': 0.1342922215516709}","{'skills': 0.5189036393249465, 'primitives': 0.4021207340482581, 'recombined': 0.25492651101575814, 'behaviors': 0.18707448745592076, 'tasks': 0.17397604590378818, 'mcp': 0.16084829361930325, 'reusable': 0.16084829361930325, 'composable': 0.15438981544980546, 'able': 0.13199029697876033, 'multiplicative': 0.127928946691576}"
Legendre Memory Units: Continuous-Time Representation in Recurrent Neural Networks,"Aaron Voelker, Ivana Kajić, Chris Eliasmith","We propose a novel memory cell for recurrent neural networks that dynamically maintains information across long windows of time using relatively few resources. The Legendre Memory Unit~(LMU) is mathematically derived to orthogonalize its continuous-time history -- doing so by solving $d$ coupled ordinary differential equations~(ODEs), whose phase space linearly maps onto sliding windows of time via the Legendre polynomials up to degree $d - 1$. Backpropagation across LMUs outperforms equivalently-sized LSTMs on a chaotic time-series prediction task, improves memory capacity by two orders of magnitude, and significantly reduces training and inference times. LMUs can efficiently handle temporal dependencies spanning $100\text{,}000$ time-steps, converge rapidly, and use few internal state-variables to learn complex functions spanning long windows of time -- exceeding state-of-the-art performance among RNNs on permuted sequential MNIST. These results are due to the network's disposition to learn scale-invariant features independently of step size. Backpropagation through the ODE solver allows each layer to adapt its internal time-step, enabling the network to learn task-relevant time-scales. We demonstrate that LMU memory cells can be implemented using $m$ recurrently-connected Poisson spiking neurons, $\mathcal{O}( m )$ time and memory, with error scaling as $\mathcal{O}( d / \sqrt{m} )$. We discuss implementations of LMUs on analog and digital neuromorphic hardware.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/952285b9b7e7a1be5aa7849f32ffff05-Paper.pdf,2019,"time, memory, learn, lmus, windows, across, backpropagation, internal, legendre, lmu","memory, time, lmu, state, task, network, input, steps, 10, across","{'legendre': 0.46397288688131055, 'units': 0.46397288688131055, 'memory': 0.33652490220803066, 'continuous': 0.3228485399069964, 'recurrent': 0.31700702424452853, 'representation': 0.31167413826591284, 'time': 0.2759333793422599, 'networks': 0.1977431152182437, 'neural': 0.1977431152182437}","{'time': 0.3006461306598286, 'lmus': 0.2990948585211164, 'windows': 0.27170889264361214, 'memory': 0.2662829579126067, 'legendre': 0.19939657234741093, 'lmu': 0.19939657234741093, 'spanning': 0.16288195117740534, 'backpropagation': 0.15220210912115925, 'internal': 0.15220210912115925, 'mathcal': 0.1308424250086671}"

Adaptive Density Estimation for Generative Models,"Thomas Lucas, Konstantin Shmelkov, Karteek Alahari, Cordelia Schmid, Jakob Verbeek","Unsupervised learning of generative models has seen tremendous progress over recent years, in particular due to generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders, and flow-based models.  GANs have dramatically improved sample quality, but suffer from two drawbacks: (i) they mode-drop, \ie,  do not cover the full support of the train data, and (ii) they do not allow for likelihood evaluations on held-out data.  In contrast likelihood-based training encourages models to cover the full support of the train data, but yields poorer samples.  These mutual shortcomings can in principle be addressed by training generative latent variable models in a hybrid adversarial-likelihood manner.  However, we show that commonly made parametric assumptions create a conflict between them, making successful hybrid models non trivial.  As a solution, we propose the use of deep invertible transformations in the latent variable decoder.  This approach allows for likelihood computations in image space, is more efficient than fully invertible models, and can take full advantage of adversarial training.  We show that our model significantly improves over existing hybrid models: offering GAN-like samples, IS and FID scores that are competitive with fully adversarial models and improved likelihood scores.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/959ab9a0695c467e7caf75431a872e5c-Paper.pdf,2019,"models, likelihood, adversarial, data, full, generative, hybrid, training, based, cover","pθ, model, training, models, data, adversarial, ade, av, fψ, likelihood","{'density': 0.6088001631358128, 'adaptive': 0.4095010810217553, 'estimation': 0.4095010810217553, 'generative': 0.3985579647291472, 'models': 0.3676025563034014}","{'likelihood': 0.3302109574864589, 'hybrid': 0.27650006371855984, 'models': 0.27504759375026355, 'adversarial': 0.20923231591346725, 'cover': 0.20338244401552039, 'full': 0.1973207327356945, 'invertible': 0.19434144134470394, 'scores': 0.16115280721453507, 'generative': 0.15760744591966083, 'gans': 0.15386796324100901}"

The DBT block can uniformly divide input channels into several semantic groups.

Efficient and Accurate Estimation of Lipschitz Constants for Deep Neural Networks,"Mahyar Fazlyab, Alexander Robey, Hamed Hassani, Manfred Morari, George Pappas","Tight estimation of the Lipschitz constant for deep neural networks (DNNs) is useful in many applications ranging from robustness certification of classifiers to stability analysis of closed-loop systems with reinforcement learning controllers. Existing methods in the literature for estimating the Lipschitz constant suffer from either lack of accuracy or poor scalability. In this paper, we present a convex optimization framework to compute guaranteed upper bounds on the Lipschitz constant of DNNs both accurately and efficiently. Our main idea is to interpret activation functions as gradients of convex potential functions. Hence, they satisfy certain properties that can be described by quadratic constraints. This particular description allows us to pose the Lipschitz constant estimation problem as a semidefinite program (SDP). The resulting SDP can be adapted to increase either the estimation accuracy (by capturing the interaction between activation functions of different layers) or scalability (by decomposition and parallel implementation).  We illustrate the utility of our approach with a variety of experiments on randomly generated networks and on classifiers trained on the MNIST and Iris datasets. In particular, we experimentally demonstrate that our Lipschitz bounds are the most accurate compared to those in the literature. We also study the impact of adversarial training methods on the Lipschitz bounds of the resulting classifiers and show that our bounds can be used to efficiently provide robustness guarantees.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/95e1533eb1b20a97777749fb94fdb944-Paper.pdf,2019,"lipschitz, bounds, constant, classifiers, estimation, functions, accuracy, activation, convex, dnns","latexit, lipschitz, sha1_base64, constant, networks, neural, network, bounds, layer, lipsdp","{'constants': 0.5221214132146577, 'lipschitz': 0.4743145091544818, 'accurate': 0.398542358943529, 'estimation': 0.31904115012487877, 'efficient': 0.28753816527662196, 'deep': 0.24510832980729733, 'networks': 0.2225257502980551, 'neural': 0.2225257502980551}","{'lipschitz': 0.4700542096370935, 'constant': 0.2527689013182973, 'sdp': 0.2101328090664813, 'classifiers': 0.20742724438512888, 'bounds': 0.19756670954331837, 'dnns': 0.17656391234177857, 'estimation': 0.1649959058972101, 'scalability': 0.15668473654569784, 'activation': 0.15413695090003757, 'functions': 0.14527320310780417}"

Kernelized Bayesian Softmax for Text Generation,"Ning Miao, Hao Zhou, Chengqi Zhao, Wenxian Shi, Lei Li","Neural models for text generation require a softmax layer with proper token embeddings during the decoding phase.
Most existing approaches adopt single point embedding for each token. 
However, a word may have multiple senses according to different context, some of which might be distinct. 
In this paper, we propose KerBS, a novel approach for learning better embeddings for text generation. 
KerBS embodies two advantages: 
(a) it employs a Bayesian composition of embeddings for words with multiple senses;
(b) it is adaptive to semantic variances of words and robust to rare sentence context by imposing learned kernels to capture the closeness of words (senses) in the embedding space.
Empirical studies show that KerBS significantly boosts the performance of several text generation tasks.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/967c2ae04b169f07e7fa8fdfd110551e-Paper.pdf,2019,"embeddings, generation, kerbs, senses, text, words, context, embedding, multiple, token","word, kerbs, embedding, sense, et, al, generation, words, embeddings, context","{'kernelized': 0.5294168829926399, 'softmax': 0.5081594154470769, 'text': 0.4404526573265137, 'generation': 0.3930246475168648, 'bayesian': 0.33619169471166227}","{'kerbs': 0.40730165547925445, 'senses': 0.385486248631703, 'words': 0.28341471773719856, 'embeddings': 0.2503156304540969, 'token': 0.24667198076529295, 'text': 0.24349595603120835, 'generation': 0.21601179379933386, 'embedding': 0.15906757589127896, 'context': 0.14349907467889877, 'embodies': 0.13576721849308482}"
Bipartite expander Hopfield networks as self-decoding high-capacity error correcting codes,"Rishidev Chaudhuri, Ila Fiete","Neural network models of memory and error correction famously include the Hopfield network, which can directly store---and error-correct through its dynamics---arbitrary N-bit patterns, but only for ~N such patterns. On the other end of the spectrum, Shannon's coding theory established that it is possible to represent exponentially many states (~e^N) using N symbols in such a way that an optimal decoder could correct all noise upto a threshold. We prove that it is possible to construct an associative content-addressable network that combines the properties of strong error correcting codes and Hopfield networks: it simultaneously possesses exponentially many stable states, these states are robust enough, with large enough basins of attraction that they can be correctly recovered despite errors in a finite fraction of all nodes, and the errors are intrinsically corrected by the network’s own dynamics. The network is a two-layer Boltzmann machine with simple neural dynamics, low dynamic-range (binary) pairwise synaptic connections, and sparse expander graph connectivity.

Provably Global Convergence of Actor-Critic: A Case for Linear Quadratic Regulator with Ergodic Cost,"Zhuoran Yang, Yongxin Chen, Mingyi Hong, Zhaoran Wang","Despite the empirical success of the actor-critic algorithm, its theoretical understanding lags behind.

We establish a nonasymptotic convergence analysis of actor- critic in this setting.

Deep ReLU Networks Have Surprisingly Few Activation Patterns,"Boris Hanin, David Rolnick","The success of deep networks has been attributed in part to their expressivity: per parameter, deep networks can approximate a richer class of functions than shallow networks. In ReLU networks, the number of activation patterns is one measure of expressivity; and the maximum number of patterns grows exponentially with the depth. However, recent work has showed that the practical expressivity of deep networks - the functions they can learn rather than express - is often far from the theoretical maximum. In this paper, we show that the average number of activation patterns for ReLU networks at initialization is bounded by the total number of neurons raised to the input dimension. We show empirically that this bound, which is independent of the depth, is tight both at initialization and during training, even on memorization tasks that should maximize the number of activation patterns.

Private Hypothesis Selection,"Mark Bun, Gautam Kamath, Thomas Steinke, Steven Z. Wu","We provide a differentially private algorithm for hypothesis selection. 
  Given samples from an unknown probability distribution $P$ and a set of $m$ probability distributions $\mathcal{H}$, the goal is to output, in a $\varepsilon$-differentially private manner, a distribution from $\mathcal{H}$ whose total variation distance to $P$ is comparable to that of the best such distribution (which we denote by $\alpha$).
  The sample complexity of our basic algorithm is $O\left(\frac{\log m}{\alpha^2} + \frac{\log m}{\alpha \varepsilon}\right)$, representing a minimal cost for privacy when compared to the non-private algorithm. We also can handle infinite hypothesis classes $\mathcal{H}$ by relaxing to $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy.

  We apply our hypothesis selection algorithm to give learning algorithms for a number of natural distribution classes, including Gaussians, product distributions, sums of independent random variables, piecewise polynomials, and mixture classes.
  Our hypothesis selection procedure allows us to generically convert a cover for a class to a learning algorithm, complementing known learning lower bounds which are in terms of the size of the packing number of the class.

ObjectNet: A large-scale bias-controlled dataset for pushing the limits of object recognition models,"Andrei Barbu, David Mayo, Julian Alverio, William Luo, Christopher Wang, Dan Gutfreund, Josh Tenenbaum, Boris Katz","We collect a large real-world test set, ObjectNet, for object recognition with controls where object backgrounds, rotations, and imaging viewpoints are random. Most scientific experiments have controls, confounds which are removed from the data, to ensure that subjects cannot perform a task by exploiting trivial correlations in the data. Historically, large machine learning and computer vision datasets have lacked such controls. This has resulted in models that must be fine-tuned for new datasets and perform better on datasets than in real-world applications. When tested on ObjectNet, object detectors show a 40-45% drop in performance, with respect to their performance on other benchmarks, due to the controls for biases. Controls make ObjectNet robust to fine-tuning showing only small performance increases. We develop a highly automated platform that enables gathering datasets with controls by crowdsourcing image capturing and annotation. ObjectNet is the same size as the ImageNet test set (50,000 images), and by design does not come paired with a training set in order to encourage generalization. The dataset is both easier than ImageNet (objects are largely centered and unoccluded) and harder (due to the controls). Although we focus on object recognition here, data with controls can be gathered at scale using automated tools throughout machine learning to generate datasets that exercise models in new ways thus providing valuable feedback to researchers.

Object landmark discovery through unsupervised adaptation,"Enrique Sanchez, Georgios Tzimiropoulos","This paper proposes a method to ease the unsupervised learning of object landmark detectors. Similarly to previous methods, our approach is fully unsupervised in a sense that it does not require or make any use of annotated landmarks for the target object category. Contrary to previous works, we do however assume that a landmark detector, which has already learned a structured representation for a given object category in a fully supervised manner, is available. Under this setting, our main idea boils down to adapting the given pre-trained network to the target object categories in a fully unsupervised manner. To this end, our method uses the pre-trained network as a core which remains frozen and does not get updated during training, and learns, in an unsupervised manner, only a projection matrix to perform the adaptation to the target categories. By building upon an existing structured representation learned in a supervised manner, the optimization problem solved by our method is much more constrained with significantly less parameters to learn which seems to be important for the case of unsupervised learning.

Neural Temporal-Difference Learning Converges to Global Optima,"Qi Cai, Zhuoran Yang, Jason D. Lee, Zhaoran Wang","Temporal-difference learning (TD), coupled with neural networks, is among the most fundamental building blocks of deep reinforcement learning. However, due to the nonlinearity in value function approximation, such a coupling leads to nonconvexity and even divergence in optimization. As a result, the global convergence of neural TD remains unclear. In this paper, we prove for the first time that neural TD converges at a sublinear rate to the global optimum of the mean-squared projected Bellman error for policy evaluation. In particular, we show how such global convergence is enabled by the overparametrization of neural networks, which also plays a vital role in the empirical success of neural TD.

The Point Where Reality Meets Fantasy: Mixed Adversarial Generators for Image Splice Detection,"Vladimir V. Kniaz, Vladimir Knyaz, Fabio Remondino","Modern photo editing tools allow creating realistic manipulated images easily. While fake images can be quickly generated, learning models for their detection is challenging due to the high variety of tampering artifacts and the lack of large labeled datasets of manipulated images. In this paper, we propose a new framework for training of discriminative segmentation model via an adversarial process. We simultaneously train four models: a generative retouching model GR that translates manipulated image to the real image domain, a generative annotation model GA that estimates the pixel-wise probability of image patch being either real or fake, and two discriminators DR and DA that qualify the output of GR and GA. The aim of model GR is to maximize the probability of model GA making a mistake. Our method extends the generative adversarial networks framework with two main contributions: (1) training of a generative model GR against a deep semantic segmentation network GA that learns rich scene semantics for manipulated region detection, (2) proposing per class semantic loss that facilitates semantically consistent image retouching by the G_R. We collected large-scale manipulated image dataset to train our model. The dataset includes 16k real and fake images with pixel-level annotations of manipulated areas. The dataset also provides ground truth pixel-level object annotations.

Self-Supervised Deep Learning on Point Clouds by Reconstructing Space,"Jonathan Sauder, Bjarne Sievers","Point clouds provide a flexible and natural representation usable in countless applications such as robotics or self-driving cars. Recently, deep neural networks operating on raw point cloud data have shown promising results on supervised learning tasks such as object classification and semantic segmentation. While massive point cloud datasets can be captured using modern scanning technology, manually labelling such large 3D point clouds for supervised learning tasks is a cumbersome process. This necessitates methods that can learn from unlabelled data to significantly reduce the number of annotated samples needed in supervised learning. We propose a self-supervised learning task for deep learning on raw point cloud data in which a neural network is trained to reconstruct point clouds whose parts have been randomly rearranged. While solving this task, representations that capture semantic properties of the point cloud are learned.

Cross-Domain Transferability of Adversarial Perturbations,"Muhammad Muzammal Naseer, Salman H. Khan, Muhammad Haris Khan, Fahad Shahbaz Khan, Fatih Porikli","Adversarial examples reveal the blind spots of deep neural networks (DNNs) and represent a major concern for security-critical applications. The transferability of adversarial examples makes real-world attacks possible in black-box settings, where the attacker is forbidden to access the internal parameters of the model. The underlying assumption in most adversary generation methods, whether learning an instance-specific or an instance-agnostic perturbation, is the direct or indirect reliance on the original domain-specific data distribution. In this work, for the first time, we demonstrate the existence of domain-invariant adversaries, thereby showing common adversarial space among different datasets and models. To this end, we propose a framework capable of launching highly transferable attacks that crafts adversarial patterns to mislead networks trained on wholly different domains. For instance, an adversarial function learned on Paintings, Cartoons or Medical images can successfully perturb ImageNet samples to fool the classifier, with success rates as high as $\sim$99\% ($\ell_{\infty} \le 10$). The core of our proposed adversarial function is a generative network that is trained using a relativistic supervisory signal that enables domain-invariant perturbations. Our approach sets the new state-of-the-art for fooling rates, both under the white-box and black-box scenarios. Furthermore, despite being an instance-agnostic perturbation function, our attack outperforms the conventionally much stronger instance-specific attack methods.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/99cd3843754d20ec3c5885d805db8a32-Paper.pdf,2019,"adversarial, instance, box, domain, function, specific, agnostic, attack, attacks, black","trained, adversarial, attack, transferability, data, generator, models, domain, perturbations, rate","{'transferability': 0.5197100151566945, 'perturbations': 0.4774188360674203, 'domain': 0.4504642642773364, 'cross': 0.44326150129238506, 'adversarial': 0.32027167092166775}","{'instance': 0.3314023166585281, 'adversarial': 0.29096684119185345, 'box': 0.207023233277209, 'domain': 0.172448004226233, 'specific': 0.1581611321110476, 'perturbation': 0.15497025148429064, 'attack': 0.14940370009192866, 'black': 0.1469743083662597, 'agnostic': 0.14367238395068468, 'invariant': 0.14367238395068468}"

Recovering Bandits,"Ciara Pike-Burke, Steffen Grunewalder","We study the recovering bandits problem, a variant of the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem where the expected reward of each arm varies according to some unknown function of the time since the arm was last played. While being a natural extension of the classical bandit problem that arises in many real-world settings, this variation is accompanied by significant difficulties. In particular, methods need to plan ahead and estimate many more quantities than in the classical bandit setting.

A neurally plausible model for online recognition and postdiction in a dynamical environment,"Li Kevin Wenliang, Maneesh Sahani","Humans and other animals are frequently near-optimal in their ability to integrate noisy and ambiguous sensory data to form robust percepts---which are informed both by sensory evidence and by prior expectations about the structure of the environment. It is suggested that the brain does so using the statistical structure provided by an internal model of how latent, causal factors produce the observed patterns. In dynamic environments, such integration often takes the form of \emph{postdiction}, wherein later sensory evidence affects inferences about earlier percepts.  As the brain must operate in current time, without the luxury of acausal propagation of information, how does such postdictive inference come about? Here, we propose a general framework for neural probabilistic inference in dynamic models based on the distributed distributional code (DDC) representation of uncertainty, naturally extending the underlying encoding to incorporate implicit probabilistic beliefs about both present and past. We show that, as in other uses of the DDC, an inferential model can be learnt efficiently using samples from an internal model of the world. Applied to stimuli used in the context of psychophysics experiments, the framework provides an online and plausible mechanism for inference, including postdictive effects.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/9a0ee0a9e7a42d2d69b8f86b3a0756b1-Paper.pdf,2019,"inference, model, sensory, brain, ddc, dynamic, evidence, form, framework, internal","model, ddc, time, tone, internal, noise, recognition, xt, zt, inference","{'postdiction': 0.41558199575364246, 'environment': 0.3933230871685167, 'neurally': 0.3933230871685167, 'plausible': 0.3933230871685167, 'dynamical': 0.36528017882703306, 'recognition': 0.3219960590429553, 'online': 0.2616852948983973, 'model': 0.2399837233166804}","{'sensory': 0.28474458962710264, 'ddc': 0.25218493595773855, 'percepts': 0.25218493595773855, 'postdictive': 0.25218493595773855, 'internal': 0.19249618330688756, 'inference': 0.16457500369909006, 'brain': 0.15683664655120874, 'evidence': 0.1492132639222769, 'dynamic': 0.1442950766508051, 'probabilistic': 0.13944098970147767}"
Limits of Private Learning with Access to Public Data,"Noga Alon, Raef Bassily, Shay Moran","We consider learning problems where the training set consists of two types of examples: private and public. The goal is to design a learning algorithm that satisfies differential privacy only with respect to the private examples. This setting interpolates between private learning (where all examples are private) and classical learning (where all examples are public). 

We study the limits of learning in this setting in terms of private and public sample complexities. We show that any hypothesis class of VC-dimension $d$ can be agnostically learned up to an excess error of $\alpha$ using only (roughly) $d/\alpha$ public examples and $d/\alpha^2$ private labeled examples. This result holds even when the public examples are unlabeled. This gives a quadratic improvement over the standard $d/\alpha^2$ upper bound on the public sample complexity (where private examples can be ignored altogether if the public examples are labeled).

Optimizing Generalized PageRank Methods for Seed-Expansion Community Detection,"Pan Li, I Chien, Olgica Milenkovic","Landing probabilities (LP) of random walks (RW) over graphs encode rich information regarding graph topology. Generalized PageRanks (GPR), which represent weighted sums of LPs of RWs, utilize the discriminative power of LP features to enable many graph-based learning studies. Previous work in the area has mostly focused on evaluating suitable weights for GPRs, and only a few studies so far have attempted to derive the optimal weights of GPRs for a given application. We take a fundamental step forward in this direction by using random graph models to better our understanding of the behavior of GPRs. In this context, we provide a rigorous non-asymptotic analysis for the convergence of LPs and GPRs to their mean-field values on edge-independent random graphs. Although our theoretical results apply to many problem settings, we focus on the task of seed-expansion community detection over stochastic block models. There, we find that the predictive power of LPs decreases significantly slower than previously reported based on asymptotic findings. Given this result, we propose a new GPR, termed Inverse PR (IPR), with LP weights that increase for the initial few steps of the walks. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real, large-scale networks illustrate the superiority of IPR compared to other GPRs for seeded community detection.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/9ac1382fd8fc4b631594aa135d16ad75-Paper.pdf,2019,"gprs, graph, lp, lps, random, weights, asymptotic, based, community, detection","community, pr, lps, ppr, hpr, networks, 10, 20, may, weights","{'pagerank': 0.4092633981889401, 'seed': 0.4092633981889401, 'expansion': 0.38734291881156635, 'optimizing': 0.38734291881156635, 'community': 0.3498696118041093, 'generalized': 0.3040625253157798, 'detection': 0.2772238792498197, 'methods': 0.27059568456845107}","{'gprs': 0.49994433118079995, 'lps': 0.27250081384932145, 'lp': 0.245035028990163, 'gpr': 0.19997773247231998, 'ipr': 0.19997773247231998, 'walks': 0.18926676300866488, 'weights': 0.16454002779795784, 'random': 0.1394156265728904, 'community': 0.1366337294240117, 'graph': 0.13365351407356307}"
Importance Resampling for Off-policy Prediction,"Matthew Schlegel, Wesley Chung, Daniel Graves, Jian Qian, Martha White","Importance sampling (IS) is a common reweighting strategy for off-policy prediction in reinforcement learning.  While it is consistent and unbiased, it can result in high variance updates to the weights for the value function. In this work, we explore a resampling strategy as an alternative to reweighting. We propose Importance Resampling (IR) for off-policy prediction, which resamples experience from a replay buffer and applies standard on-policy updates. The approach avoids using importance sampling ratios in the update, instead correcting the distribution before the update. We characterize the bias and consistency of IR, particularly compared to Weighted IS (WIS). We demonstrate in several microworlds that IR has improved sample efficiency and lower variance updates, as compared to IS and several variance-reduced IS strategies, including variants of WIS and V-trace which clips IS ratios.

A Graph Theoretic Additive Approximation of Optimal Transport,"Nathaniel Lahn, Deepika Mulchandani, Sharath Raghvendra","Transportation cost is an attractive similarity measure between probability distributions due to its many useful theoretical properties.  However, solving optimal transport exactly can be prohibitively expensive. Therefore, there has been significant effort towards the design of scalable approximation algorithms. Previous combinatorial results [Sharathkumar, Agarwal STOC '12, Agarwal, Sharathkumar STOC '14] have focused primarily on the design of near-linear time multiplicative approximation algorithms. There has also been an effort to design approximate solutions with additive errors [Cuturi NIPS '13, Altschuler \etal\ NIPS '17, Dvurechensky \etal\, ICML '18, Quanrud, SOSA '19]  within a time bound that is linear in the size of the cost matrix and polynomial in $C/\delta$; here $C$ is the largest value in the cost matrix and $\delta$ is the additive error.

Our algorithm is extremely simple and executes, for an arbitrarily small constant $\eps$, only $\lfloor \frac{2C}{(1-\eps)\delta}\rfloor + 1$ iterations, where each iteration consists only of a Dijkstra-type search followed by a depth-first search.

We call this the MaxGap-bandit problem. This problem arises naturally in approximate ranking, noisy sorting, outlier detection, and top-arm identification in bandits.  The key novelty of the MaxGap bandit problem is that it aims to adaptively determine the natural partitioning of the distributions into a subset with larger means and a subset with smaller means, where the split is determined by the largest gap rather than a pre-specified rank or threshold. Estimating an arm’s gap requires sampling its neighboring arms in addition to itself, and this dependence results in a novel hardness parameter that characterizes the sample complexity of the problem.

AutoAssist: A Framework to Accelerate Training of Deep Neural Networks,"Jiong Zhang, Hsiang-Fu Yu, Inderjit S. Dhillon","Deep neural networks have yielded superior performance in many contemporary
applications. However, the gradient computation in a deep model with millions of
instances leads to a lengthy training process even with modern
GPU/TPU hardware acceleration.  In this paper, we propose AutoAssist, a
simple framework to accelerate training of a deep neural network.
Typically, as the training procedure evolves, the amount of improvement by a
stochastic gradient update varies dynamically with the choice of instances in the mini-batch.
In AutoAssist, we utilize this fact and design an instance shrinking operation that is
used to filter out instances with relatively low marginal improvement to the
current model; thus the computationally intensive gradient computations are
performed on informative instances as much as possible.
Specifically, we train
a very lightweight Assistant model jointly with the original deep network, which we refer to as Boss.
The Assistant model is designed to gauge the importance of a given
instance with respect to the current Boss such that the shrinking operation can
be applied in the batch generator. With careful design, we train the Boss and
Assistant in a nonblocking and asynchronous fashion such that
overhead is minimal.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoAssist, we conduct experiments on two
contemporary applications: image classification using ResNets with varied number
of layers, and neural machine translation using LSTMs, ConvS2S and
Transformer models. For each application, we verify that AutoAssist leads to

BIVA: A Very Deep Hierarchy of Latent Variables for Generative Modeling,"Lars Maaløe, Marco Fraccaro, Valentin Liévin, Ole Winther","With the introduction of the variational autoencoder (VAE), probabilistic latent variable models have received renewed attention as powerful generative models. However, their performance in terms of test likelihood and quality of generated samples has been surpassed by autoregressive models without stochastic units. Furthermore, flow-based models have recently been shown to be an attractive alternative that scales well to high-dimensional data. In this paper we close the performance gap by constructing VAE models that can effectively utilize a deep hierarchy of stochastic variables and model complex covariance structures. We introduce the Bidirectional-Inference Variational Autoencoder (BIVA), characterized by a skip-connected generative model and an inference network formed by a bidirectional stochastic inference path. We show that BIVA reaches state-of-the-art test likelihoods, generates sharp and coherent natural images, and uses the hierarchy of latent variables to capture different aspects of the data distribution. We observe that BIVA, in contrast to recent results, can be used for anomaly detection. We attribute this to the hierarchy of latent variables which is able to extract high-level semantic features. Finally, we extend BIVA to semi-supervised classification tasks and show that it performs comparably to state-of-the-art results by generative adversarial networks.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/9bdb8b1faffa4b3d41779bb495d79fb9-Paper.pdf,2019,"models, biva, generative, hierarchy, inference, latent, stochastic, variables, art, autoencoder","biva, model, models, variables, latent, inference, stochastic, qφ, variable, generative","{'biva': 0.49754466085422255, 'hierarchy': 0.470895765483075, 'variables': 0.40643148577618193, 'latent': 0.34620895280115543, 'modeling': 0.3217882119258165, 'generative': 0.29589914308575616, 'deep': 0.23357084720135565}","{'biva': 0.4716918253313992, 'hierarchy': 0.2628328263944741, 'bidirectional': 0.20161909976577055, 'variables': 0.19804868250900826, 'latent': 0.17639851776345805, 'vae': 0.17522188426298274, 'models': 0.17041431634223825, 'generative': 0.15624097505819853, 'autoencoder': 0.15593597295251788, 'inference': 0.15391221447056352}"
Multiway clustering via tensor block models,"Miaoyan Wang, Yuchen Zeng","We consider the problem of identifying multiway block structure from a large noisy tensor.

Bridging Machine Learning and Logical Reasoning by Abductive Learning,"Wang-Zhou Dai, Qiuling Xu, Yang Yu, Zhi-Hua Zhou","Perception and reasoning are two representative abilities of intelligence that are integrated seamlessly during human problem-solving processes. In the area of artificial intelligence (AI), the two abilities are usually realised by machine learning and logic programming, respectively. However, the two categories of techniques were developed separately throughout most of the history of AI. In this paper, we present the abductive learning targeted at unifying the two AI paradigms in a mutually beneficial way, where the machine learning model learns to perceive primitive logic facts from data, while logical reasoning can exploit symbolic domain knowledge and correct the wrongly perceived facts for improving the machine learning models. Furthermore, we propose a novel approach to optimise the machine learning model and the logical reasoning model jointly. We demonstrate that by using abductive learning, machines can learn to recognise numbers and resolve unknown mathematical operations simultaneously from images of simple hand-written equations. Moreover, the learned models can be generalised to longer equations and adapted to different tasks, which is beyond the capability of state-of-the-art deep learning models.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/9c19a2aa1d84e04b0bd4bc888792bd1e-Paper.pdf,2019,"learning, machine, two, ai, model, models, reasoning, abductive, abilities, equations","learning, abl, logical, model, knowledge, machine, labels, reasoning, training, pseudo","{'abductive': 0.47731657849850295, 'logical': 0.47731657849850295, 'bridging': 0.45175111561627207, 'reasoning': 0.3643422206846718, 'machine': 0.34238072095046745, 'learning': 0.30048109003466206}","{'ai': 0.27961860214156314, 'abductive': 0.24421470965389755, 'reasoning': 0.2386177538748661, 'facts': 0.2311343718315835, 'abilities': 0.2038004729871188, 'logical': 0.2038004729871188, 'logic': 0.1994927392500228, 'machine': 0.19130307942108993, 'learning': 0.18766813410348634, 'intelligence': 0.18641240142770876}"
Variational Structured Semantic Inference for Diverse Image Captioning,"Fuhai Chen, Rongrong Ji, Jiayi Ji, Xiaoshuai Sun, Baochang Zhang, Xuri Ge, Yongjian Wu, Feiyue Huang, Yan Wang","Despite the exciting progress in image captioning, generating diverse captions for a given image remains as an open problem. Existing methods typically apply generative models such as Variational Auto-Encoder to diversify the captions, which however neglect two key factors of diverse expression, i.e., the lexical diversity and the syntactic diversity. To model these two inherent diversities in image captioning, we propose a Variational Structured Semantic Inferring model (termed VSSI-cap) executed in a novel structured encoder-inferer-decoder schema. VSSI-cap mainly innovates in a novel structure, i.e., Variational Multi-modal Inferring tree (termed VarMI-tree). In particular, conditioned on the visual-textual features from the encoder, the VarMI-tree models the lexical and syntactic diversities by inferring their latent variables (with variations) in an approximate posterior inference guided by a visual semantic prior. Then, a reconstruction loss and the posterior-prior KL-divergence are jointly estimated to optimize the VSSI-cap model. Finally, diverse captions are generated upon the visual features and the latent variables from this structured encoder-inferer-decoder model. Experiments on the benchmark dataset show that the proposed VSSI-cap achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-arts.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/9c3b1830513cc3b8fc4b76635d32e692-Paper.pdf,2019,"cap, encoder, model, vssi, captions, diverse, image, inferring, structured, tree","tree, cap, image, vssi, syntactic, lexical, captioning, diverse, model, node","{'captioning': 0.4639037660741728, 'diverse': 0.4488511845516135, 'semantic': 0.3703885882340656, 'structured': 0.3703885882340656, 'inference': 0.32363099931401207, 'image': 0.3195414477370488, 'variational': 0.3195414477370488}","{'vssi': 0.36312625277090343, 'cap': 0.3436769163033095, 'captions': 0.24740804435269345, 'encoder': 0.224480998933779, 'inferring': 0.1913522734573461, 'diversities': 0.18156312638545172, 'inferer': 0.18156312638545172, 'lexical': 0.18156312638545172, 'varmi': 0.18156312638545172, 'diverse': 0.16457030198591896}"
Input-Output Equivalence of Unitary and Contractive RNNs,"Melikasadat Emami, Mojtaba Sahraee Ardakan, Sundeep Rangan, Alyson K.

A basic question is how restrictive is the unitary constraint on the possible input-output mappings of such a network? This works shows that for any contractive RNN with ReLU activations, there is a URNN with at most twice the number of hidden states and the identical input-output mapping.  Hence, with ReLU activations, URNNs are as expressive as general RNNs.  In contrast, for certain smooth activations, it is shown that the input-output mapping of an RNN cannot be matched with a URNN, even with an arbitrary number of states.

In this paper, we propose an approach to differentiating through disciplined convex programs, a subclass of convex optimization problems used by domain-specific languages (DSLs) for convex optimization. We introduce disciplined parametrized programming, a subset of disciplined convex programming, and we show that every disciplined parametrized program can be represented as the composition of an affine map from parameters to problem data, a solver, and an affine map from the solver’s solution to a solution of the original problem (a new form we refer to as affine-solver-affine form). We then demonstrate how to efficiently differentiate through each of these components, allowing for end-to-end analytical differentiation through the entire convex program. We implement our methodology in version 1.1 of CVXPY, a popular Python-embedded DSL for convex optimization, and additionally implement differentiable layers for disciplined convex programs in PyTorch and TensorFlow 2.0.

Partially Encrypted Deep Learning using Functional Encryption,"Théo Ryffel, David Pointcheval, Francis Bach, Edouard Dufour-Sans, Romain Gay","Machine learning on encrypted data has received a lot of attention thanks to recent breakthroughs in homomorphic encryption and secure multi-party computation. It allows outsourcing computation to untrusted servers without sacrificing privacy of sensitive data. We propose a practical framework to perform partially encrypted and privacy-preserving predictions which combines adversarial training and functional encryption. We first present a new functional encryption scheme to efficiently compute quadratic functions so that the data owner controls what can be computed but is not involved in the calculation: it provides a decryption key which allows one to learn a specific function evaluation of some encrypted data.

Last, since several encryption schemes cannot deal with the last thresholding operation used for classification, we propose a training method to prevent selected sensitive features from leaking which adversarially optimizes the network against an adversary trying to identify these features.

Graph Transformer Networks,"Seongjun Yun, Minbyul Jeong, Raehyun Kim, Jaewoo Kang, Hyunwoo J. Kim","Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used in representation learning on graphs and achieved state-of-the-art performance in tasks such as node classification and link prediction. However, most existing GNNs are designed to learn node representations on the fixed and homogeneous graphs. The limitations especially become problematic when learning representations on a misspecified graph or a heterogeneous graph that consists of various types of nodes and edges. In this paper, we propose Graph Transformer Networks (GTNs) that are capable of generating new graph structures, which involve identifying useful connections between unconnected nodes on the original graph, while learning effective node representation on the new graphs in an end-to-end fashion. Graph Transformer layer, a core layer of GTNs, learns a soft selection of edge types and composite relations for generating useful multi-hop connections so-call meta-paths. Our experiments show that GTNs learn new graph structures, based on data and tasks without domain knowledge, and yield powerful node representation via convolution on the new graphs. Without domain-specific graph preprocessing, GTNs achieved the best performance in all three benchmark node classification tasks against the state-of-the-art methods that require pre-defined meta-paths from domain knowledge.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/9d63484abb477c97640154d40595a3bb-Paper.pdf,2019,"graph, node, graphs, gtns, new, domain, learning, representation, tasks, achieved","graph, meta, paths, node, adjacency, path, matrix, graphs, gtn, heterogeneous","{'transformer': 0.7670016592736978, 'graph': 0.5081995201604186, 'networks': 0.3917163544966114}","{'graph': 0.4080740043073049, 'gtns': 0.4070510959023926, 'node': 0.3010559610354472, 'graphs': 0.220697383941199, 'paths': 0.16308819008157896, 'domain': 0.15912685610489824, 'gnns': 0.1553538122222086, 'transformer': 0.13456648021477374, 'representation': 0.13453639085784264, 'new': 0.12782416910859332}"
Non-normal Recurrent Neural Network (nnRNN): learning long time dependencies while improving expressivity with transient dynamics,"Giancarlo Kerg, Kyle Goyette, Maximilian Puelma Touzel, Gauthier Gidel, Eugene Vorontsov, Yoshua Bengio, Guillaume Lajoie","A recent strategy to circumvent the exploding and vanishing gradient problem in RNNs, and to allow the stable propagation of signals over long time scales, is to constrain recurrent connectivity matrices to be orthogonal or unitary. This ensures eigenvalues with unit norm and thus stable dynamics and training. However this comes at the cost of reduced expressivity due to the limited variety of orthogonal transformations. We propose a novel connectivity structure based on the Schur decomposition and a splitting of the Schur form into normal and non-normal parts. 
This allows to parametrize matrices with unit-norm eigenspectra without orthogonality constraints on eigenbases. The resulting architecture ensures access to a larger space of spectrally constrained matrices, of which orthogonal matrices are a subset.

The ability to increase the number of parameters while keeping the same computational budget lets the overall system strike a better trade-off between prediction accuracy and computation efficiency both at training and test time. This memory layer allows us to tackle very large scale language modeling tasks.

Computing Full Conformal Prediction Set with Approximate Homotopy,"Eugene Ndiaye, Ichiro Takeuchi","If you are predicting the label $y$ of a new object with $\hat y$, how confident are you that $y = \hat y$? Conformal prediction methods provide an elegant framework for answering such question by building a $100 (1 - \alpha)\%$ confidence region without assumptions on the distribution of the data. It is based on a refitting procedure that parses all the possibilities for $y$ to select the most likely ones.

AttentionXML: Label Tree-based Attention-Aware Deep Model for High-Performance Extreme Multi-Label Text Classification,"Ronghui You, Zihan Zhang, Ziye Wang, Suyang Dai, Hiroshi Mamitsuka, Shanfeng Zhu","Extreme multi-label text classification (XMTC) is an important problem in the 
era of {\it big data}, for tagging a given text with the most relevant multiple 
labels from an extremely large-scale label set. XMTC can be found in many 
applications, such as item categorization, web page tagging, and news 
annotation.
Traditionally most methods used bag-of-words (BOW) as inputs, ignoring word 
context as well as deep semantic information. Recent attempts to overcome the 
problems of BOW by deep learning still suffer from 1) failing to capture the 
important subtext for each label and 2) lack of scalability against the huge 
number of labels.
We propose a new label tree-based deep learning model for XMTC, called 
AttentionXML, with two unique features: 1) a multi-label attention mechanism 
with raw text as input, which allows to capture the most relevant part of text 
to each label; and 2) a shallow and wide probabilistic label tree (PLT), which 
allows to handle millions of labels, especially for ""tail labels"".
We empirically compared the performance of AttentionXML with those of eight 
state-of-the-art methods over six benchmark datasets, including Amazon-3M with 
around 3 million labels. AttentionXML outperformed all competing methods 
under all experimental settings.
Experimental results also show that AttentionXML achieved the best performance

Policy Learning for Fairness in Ranking,"Ashudeep Singh, Thorsten Joachims","Conventional Learning-to-Rank (LTR) methods optimize the utility of the rankings to the users, but they are oblivious to their impact on the ranked items. However, there has been a growing understanding that the latter is important to consider for a wide range of ranking applications (e.g. online marketplaces, job placement, admissions). To address this need, we propose a general LTR framework that can optimize a wide range of utility metrics (e.g. NDCG) while satisfying fairness of exposure constraints with respect to the items. This framework expands the class of learnable ranking functions to stochastic ranking policies, which provides a language for rigorously expressing fairness specifications. Furthermore, we provide a new LTR algorithm called Fair-PG-Rank for directly searching the space of fair ranking policies via a policy-gradient approach.

To theoretically elucidate the effectiveness of normalization, we quantify the geometry of the parameter space determined by the Fisher information matrix (FIM), which also corresponds to the local shape of the loss landscape under certain conditions. We analyze deep neural networks with random initialization, which is known to suffer from a pathologically sharp shape of the landscape when the network becomes sufficiently wide. We reveal that batch normalization in the last layer contributes to drastically decreasing such pathological sharpness if the width and sample number satisfy a specific condition. In contrast, it is hard for batch normalization in the middle hidden layers to alleviate pathological sharpness in many settings. We also found that layer normalization cannot alleviate pathological sharpness either. Thus, we can conclude that batch normalization in the last layer significantly contributes to decreasing the sharpness induced by the FIM.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/9edda0fd4d983bf975935cfd492fd50b-Paper.pdf,2019,"normalization, sharpness, batch, layer, pathological, alleviate, also, contributes, decreasing, deep","normalization, ql, layer, batch, fim, λmax, sharpness, dnns, mean, pathological","{'pathological': 0.4430669622022467, 'sharpness': 0.4430669622022467, 'alleviating': 0.4193359365333785, 'wide': 0.3787674801970971, 'normalization': 0.3488699236688237, 'method': 0.30830146733254227, 'networks': 0.18883310605726966, 'neural': 0.18883310605726966}","{'normalization': 0.4356593422363129, 'sharpness': 0.415748343014571, 'pathological': 0.31181125726092823, 'fim': 0.21963816993946242, 'contributes': 0.19952748178821517, 'batch': 0.19024976903395602, 'decreasing': 0.167652795204791, 'layer': 0.1633089442939731, 'last': 0.1631803305720929, 'landscape': 0.15754716756051307}"
Re-randomized Densification for One Permutation Hashing and Bin-wise Consistent Weighted Sampling,"Ping Li, Xiaoyun Li, Cun-Hui Zhang","Jaccard similarity is widely used as a distance measure in many machine learning
and search applications. Typically, hashing methods are essential for the use of
Jaccard similarity to be practical in large-scale settings. For hashing binary (0/1)
data, the idea of one permutation hashing (OPH) with densification significantly
accelerates traditional minwise hashing algorithms while providing unbiased and
accurate estimates. In this paper, we propose a strategy named “re-randomization”
in the process of densification that could achieve the smallest variance among all
densification schemes. The success of this idea naturally inspires us to generalize
one permutation hashing to weighted (non-binary) data, which results in the socalled “bin-wise consistent weighted sampling (BCWS)” algorithm. We analyze the
behavior of BCWS and compare it with a recent alternative. Extensive experiments

Beyond Online Balanced Descent: An Optimal Algorithm for Smoothed Online Optimization,"Gautam Goel, Yiheng Lin, Haoyuan Sun, Adam Wierman","We study online convex optimization in a setting where the learner seeks to minimize the sum of a per-round hitting cost and a movement cost which is incurred when changing decisions between rounds.  We prove a new lower bound on the competitive ratio of any online algorithm in the setting where the costs are $m$-strongly convex and the movement costs are the squared $\ell_2$ norm. This lower bound shows that no algorithm can achieve a competitive ratio that is  $o(m^{-1/2})$ as $m$ tends to zero.  No existing algorithms have competitive ratios matching this bound, and we show that the state-of-the-art algorithm, Online Balanced Decent (OBD), has a competitive ratio that is $\Omega(m^{-2/3})$. We additionally propose two new algorithms, Greedy OBD (G-OBD) and Regularized OBD (R-OBD) and prove that both algorithms have an $O(m^{-1/2})$ competitive ratio. The result for G-OBD holds when the hitting costs are quasiconvex and the movement costs are the squared $\ell_2$ norm, while the result for R-OBD holds when the hitting costs are $m$-strongly convex and the movement costs are Bregman Divergences.

Reconciling λ-Returns with Experience Replay,"Brett Daley, Christopher Amato","Modern deep reinforcement learning methods have departed from the incremental learning required for eligibility traces, rendering the implementation of the λ-return difficult in this context. In particular, off-policy methods that utilize experience replay remain problematic because their random sampling of minibatches is not conducive to the efficient calculation of λ-returns. Yet replay-based methods are often the most sample efficient, and incorporating λ-returns into them is a viable way to achieve new state-of-the-art performance. Towards this, we propose the first method to enable practical use of λ-returns in arbitrary replay-based methods without relying on other forms of decorrelation such as asynchronous gradient updates. By promoting short sequences of past transitions into a small cache within the replay memory, adjacent λ-returns can be efficiently precomputed by sharing Q-values. Computation is not wasted on experiences that are never sampled, and stored λ-returns behave as stable temporal-difference (TD) targets that replace the target network. Additionally, our method grants the unique ability to observe TD errors prior to sampling; for the first time, transitions can be prioritized by their true significance rather than by a proxy to it. Furthermore, we propose the novel use of the TD error to dynamically select λ-values that facilitate faster learning. We show that these innovations can enhance the performance of DQN when playing Atari 2600 games, even under partial observability. While our work specifically focuses on λ-returns, these ideas are applicable to any multi-step return estimator.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/9f396fe44e7c05c16873b05ec425cbad-Paper.pdf,2019,"returns, methods, replay, learning, td, based, efficient, first, method, performance","dqn, returns, return, step, replay, st, learning, network, cache, values","{'returns': 0.5382400368413724, 'reconciling': 0.5094114641425471, 'experience': 0.48895726629918423, 'replay': 0.46012869360035885}","{'returns': 0.4395339095296396, 'replay': 0.30248999600468673, 'td': 0.2506405043098821, 'return': 0.15916933377113238, 'transitions': 0.15696452036012484, 'methods': 0.12079191579816284, 'values': 0.11438131467066727, 'conducive': 0.10426208861376607, 'departed': 0.10426208861376607, 'eligibility': 0.10426208861376607}"

Finite-Sample Analysis for SARSA with Linear Function Approximation,"Shaofeng Zou, Tengyu Xu, Yingbin Liang","SARSA is an on-policy algorithm to learn a Markov decision process policy in reinforcement learning. We investigate the SARSA algorithm with linear function approximation under the non-i.i.d.\ setting, where a single sample trajectory is available. With a Lipschitz continuous policy improvement operator that is smooth enough, SARSA has been shown to converge asymptotically. However, its non-asymptotic analysis is challenging and remains unsolved due to the non-i.i.d.  samples, and the fact that the behavior policy changes dynamically with time. In this paper, we develop a novel technique to explicitly characterize the stochastic bias of a type of stochastic approximation procedures with time-varying Markov transition kernels. Our approach enables non-asymptotic convergence analyses of this type of stochastic approximation algorithms, which may be of independent interest. Using  our bias characterization technique and a  gradient descent type of analysis, we further provide the finite-sample analysis on the  mean square error of the SARSA algorithm.

Aligning Visual Regions and Textual Concepts for Semantic-Grounded Image Representations,"Fenglin Liu, Yuanxin Liu, Xuancheng Ren, Xiaodong He, Xu Sun","In vision-and-language grounding problems, fine-grained representations of the image are considered to be of paramount importance. Most of the current systems incorporate visual features and textual concepts as a sketch of an image. However, plainly inferred representations are usually undesirable in that they are composed of separate components, the relations of which are elusive. In this work, we aim at representing an image with a set of integrated visual regions and corresponding textual concepts, reflecting certain semantics. To this end, we build the Mutual Iterative Attention (MIA) module, which integrates correlated visual features and textual concepts, respectively, by aligning the two modalities. We evaluate the proposed approach on two representative vision-and-language grounding tasks, i.e., image captioning and visual question answering. In both tasks, the semantic-grounded image representations consistently boost the performance of the baseline models under all metrics across the board. The results demonstrate that our approach is effective and generalizes well to a wide range of models for image-related applications.

Network Pruning via Transformable Architecture Search,"Xuanyi Dong, Yi Yang","Network pruning reduces the computation costs of an over-parameterized network without performance damage. Prevailing pruning algorithms pre-define the width and depth of the pruned networks, and then transfer parameters from the unpruned network to pruned networks. To break the structure limitation of the pruned networks, we propose to apply neural architecture search to search directly for a network with flexible channel and layer sizes. The number of the channels/layers is learned by minimizing the loss of the pruned networks. The feature map of the pruned network is an aggregation of K feature map fragments (generated by K networks of different sizes), which are sampled based on the probability distribution. The loss can be back-propagated not only to the network weights, but also to the parameterized distribution to explicitly tune the size of the channels/layers. Specifically, we apply channel-wise interpolation to keep the feature map with different channel sizes aligned in the aggregation procedure. The maximum probability for the size in each distribution serves as the width and depth of the pruned network, whose parameters are learned by knowledge transfer, e.g., knowledge distillation, from the original networks. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness of our new perspective of network pruning compared to traditional network pruning algorithms. Various searching and knowledge transfer approaches are conducted to show the effectiveness of the two components.

Online Stochastic Shortest Path with Bandit Feedback and Unknown Transition Function,"Aviv Rosenberg, Yishay Mansour","We  consider  online  learning  in  episodic loop-free Markov decision processes (MDPs), where the loss function can change arbitrarily between episodes. 
The transition function is fixed but unknown to the learner, and the learner only observes bandit feedback (not the entire loss function).
For this problem we develop no-regret algorithms that perform asymptotically as well as the best stationary policy in hindsight.

When this assumption is removed we give a regret bound of $\tilde{O} ( L^{3/2} |X| |A|^{1/4} T^{3/4})$, that holds for an arbitrary transition function.

Selective Sampling-based Scalable Sparse Subspace Clustering,"Shin Matsushima, Maria Brbic","Sparse subspace clustering (SSC) represents each data point as a sparse linear combination of other data points in the dataset. In the representation learning step SSC finds a lower dimensional representation of data points, while in the spectral clustering step data points are clustered according to the underlying subspaces. However, both steps suffer from high computational and memory complexity, preventing the application of SSC to large-scale datasets. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Selective Sampling-based Scalable Sparse Subspace Clustering (S5C) algorithm which selects subsamples based on the approximated subgradients and linearly scales with the number of data points in terms of time and memory requirements. Along with the computational advantages, we derive theoretical guarantees for the correctness of S5C.

Behavior has traditionally been characterized by low-dimensional, task-related variables such as movement speed or response times. More recently, there has been a growing interest in automated analysis of high-dimensional video data collected during experiments. Here we introduce a probabilistic framework for the analysis of behavioral video and neural activity. This framework provides tools for compression, segmentation, generation, and decoding of behavioral videos. Compression is performed using a convolutional autoencoder (CAE), which yields a low-dimensional continuous representation of behavior. We then use an autoregressive hidden Markov model (ARHMM) to segment the CAE representation into discrete ""behavioral syllables."" The resulting generative model can be used to simulate behavioral video data. Finally, based on this generative model, we develop a novel Bayesian decoding approach that takes in neural activity and outputs probabilistic estimates of the full-resolution behavioral video.

On the Global Convergence of (Fast) Incremental Expectation Maximization Methods,"Belhal Karimi, Hoi-To Wai, Eric Moulines, Marc Lavielle","The EM algorithm is one of the most popular algorithm for inference in latent data models. The original formulation of the EM algorithm does not scale to large data set, because the whole data set is required at each iteration of the algorithm. To alleviate this problem, Neal and Hinton [1998] have proposed an incremental version of the EM (iEM) in which at each iteration the conditional expectation of the latent data (E-step) is updated only for a mini-batch of observations. Another approach has been proposed by Cappe and Moulines [2009] in which the E-step is replaced by a stochastic approximation step, closely related to stochastic gradient.

We prove that GALA agents remain within an epsilon-ball of one-another during training when using loosely coupled asynchronous communication. By reducing the amount of synchronization between agents, GALA is more computationally efficient and scalable compared to A2C, its fully-synchronous counterpart.

Fast and Accurate Stochastic Gradient Estimation,"Beidi Chen, Yingchen Xu, Anshumali Shrivastava","Stochastic Gradient Descent or SGD is the most popular optimization algorithm for large-scale problems. SGD estimates the gradient by uniform sampling with sample size one. There have been several other works that suggest faster epoch-wise convergence by using weighted non-uniform sampling for better gradient estimates. Unfortunately, the per-iteration cost of maintaining this adaptive distribution for gradient estimation is more than calculating the full gradient itself, which we call the chicken-and-the-egg loop. As a result, the false impression of faster convergence in iterations, in reality, leads to slower convergence in time. In this paper, we break this barrier by providing the first demonstration of a scheme, Locality sensitive hashing (LSH) sampled Stochastic Gradient Descent (LGD), which leads to superior gradient estimation while keeping the sampling cost per iteration similar to that of the uniform sampling. Such an algorithm is possible due to the sampling view of LSH, which came to light recently. As a consequence of superior and fast estimation, we reduce the running time of all existing gradient descent algorithms, that relies on gradient estimates including Adam, Ada-grad, etc. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal with experiments on linear models as well as the non-linear BERT, which is a recent popular deep learning based language representation model.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/a1e865a9b1065392ed6035d8ccd072d9-Paper.pdf,2019,"gradient, sampling, convergence, descent, estimates, estimation, uniform, algorithm, cost, faster","sgd, gradient, lgd, xi, sampling, θt, loss, convergence, time, algorithm","{'accurate': 0.533429298724441, 'fast': 0.45197242991658937, 'estimation': 0.42702085024660447, 'stochastic': 0.4073984547301756, 'gradient': 0.4035514817167407}","{'gradient': 0.3820226444901073, 'sampling': 0.2698195092187537, 'uniform': 0.21639212907273547, 'lsh': 0.21199380386654798, 'estimates': 0.19938871728070723, 'estimation': 0.16645715568619404, 'descent': 0.1611079663456475, 'convergence': 0.14800038267162927, 'iteration': 0.1460234038884042, 'sgd': 0.14259472501800097}"
Learning Disentangled Representations for Recommendation,"Jianxin Ma, Chang Zhou, Peng Cui, Hongxia Yang, Wenwu Zhu","User behavior data in recommender systems are driven by the complex interactions of many latent factors behind the users’ decision making processes. The factors are highly entangled, and may range from high-level ones that govern user intentions, to low-level ones that characterize a user’s preference when executing an intention. Learning representations that uncover and disentangle these latent factors can bring enhanced robustness, interpretability, and controllability. However, learning such disentangled representations from user behavior is challenging, and remains largely neglected by the existing literature. In this paper, we present the MACRo-mIcro Disentangled Variational Auto-Encoder (MacridVAE) for learning disentangled representations from user behavior. Our approach achieves macro disentanglement by inferring the high-level concepts associated with user intentions (e.g., to buy a shirt or a cellphone), while capturing the preference of a user regarding the different concepts separately. A micro-disentanglement regularizer, stemming from an information-theoretic interpretation of VAEs, then forces each dimension of the representations to independently reflect an isolated low-level factor (e.g., the size or the color of a shirt). Empirical results show that our approach can achieve substantial improvement over the state-of-the-art baselines. We further demonstrate that the learned representations are interpretable and controllable, which can potentially lead to a new paradigm for recommendation where users are given fine-grained control over targeted aspects of the recommendation lists.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/a2186aa7c086b46ad4e8bf81e2a3a19b-Paper.pdf,2019,"user, representations, level, behavior, disentangled, factors, learning, approach, concepts, disentanglement","user, zu, representations, xu, items, disentanglement, pθ, item, ci, learning","{'recommendation': 0.6416995191566686, 'disentangled': 0.5770216171408307, 'representations': 0.45368793404314, 'learning': 0.22233991762602695}","{'user': 0.4255801025339512, 'disentangled': 0.22442734268094502, 'representations': 0.2185468190182782, 'shirt': 0.19310373601102884, 'level': 0.1903303998441491, 'intentions': 0.18276094337026252, 'macro': 0.18276094337026252, 'micro': 0.17542261520753213, 'factors': 0.166492730588334, 'disentanglement': 0.16507982256676582}"
Learning Latent Process from High-Dimensional Event Sequences via Efficient Sampling,"Qitian Wu, Zixuan Zhang, Xiaofeng Gao, Junchi Yan, Guihai Chen","We target modeling latent dynamics in high-dimension marked event sequences without any prior knowledge about marker relations. Such problem has been rarely studied by previous works which would have fundamental difficulty to handle the arisen challenges: 1) the high-dimensional markers and unknown relation network among them pose intractable obstacles for modeling the latent dynamic process; 2) one observed event sequence may concurrently contain several different chains of interdependent events; 3) it is hard to well define the distance between two high-dimension event sequences. To these ends, in this paper, we propose a seminal adversarial imitation learning framework for high-dimension event sequence generation which could be decomposed into: 1) a latent structural intensity model that estimates the adjacent nodes without explicit networks and learns to capture the temporal dynamics in the latent space of markers over observed sequence; 2) an efficient random walk based generation model that aims at imitating the generation process of high-dimension event sequences from a bottom-up view; 3) a discriminator specified as a seq2seq network optimizing the rewards to help the generator output event sequences as real as possible. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method could effectively detect the hidden network among markers and make decent prediction for future marked events, even when the number of markers scales to million level.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/a29d1598024f9e87beab4b98411d48ce-Paper.pdf,2019,"event, high, dimension, latent, markers, sequences, generation, network, sequence, among","event, marker, network, markers, time, sequences, model, sequence, lantern, process","{'event': 0.42808682051755226, 'sequences': 0.4108980190528252, 'process': 0.36948296259505015, 'dimensional': 0.32444562762893486, 'latent': 0.314735235912171, 'sampling': 0.29680419761590626, 'high': 0.2866528496795, 'efficient': 0.24909392446134795, 'via': 0.2334178442143707, 'learning': 0.14237042257561336}","{'event': 0.4564593912962408, 'markers': 0.3594181647121461, 'sequences': 0.2456096168920361, 'dimension': 0.21171033404259096, 'latent': 0.18935754994835305, 'high': 0.18286541223712713, 'marked': 0.17249329436640246, 'sequence': 0.15442472180861352, 'generation': 0.15105317522826545, 'events': 0.13934034244924742}"
Using Self-Supervised Learning Can Improve Model Robustness and Uncertainty,"Dan Hendrycks, Mantas Mazeika, Saurav Kadavath, Dawn Song","Self-supervision provides effective representations for downstream tasks without requiring labels.

Random Projections with Asymmetric Quantization,"Xiaoyun Li, Ping Li","The method of random projection has been a popular tool for data compression,
similarity search, and machine learning. In many practical scenarios, applying
quantization on randomly projected data could be very helpful to further reduce
storage cost and facilitate more efficient retrievals, while only suffering from

different sources may be quantized under different schemes, which calls for a need to study the asymmetric quantization problem. In this paper, we investigate the cosine similarity estimators derived in such setting under the Lloyd-Max (LM)
quantization scheme. We thoroughly analyze the biases and variances of a series of estimators including the basic simple estimators, their normalized versions, and
their debiased versions. Furthermore, by studying the monotonicity, we show that

Since the latent representations are generated from Dirichlet distributions, we further develop a data augmentation trick to enable efficient Gibbs sampling for Ber-Poisson likelihood with Dirichlet random variables.

Better Exploration with Optimistic Actor Critic,"Kamil Ciosek, Quan Vuong, Robert Loftin, Katja Hofmann","Actor-critic methods, a type of model-free Reinforcement Learning, have been successfully applied to challenging tasks in continuous control, often achieving state-of-the art performance. However, wide-scale adoption of these methods in real-world domains is made difficult by their poor sample efficiency. We address this problem both theoretically and empirically. On the theoretical side, we identify two phenomena preventing efficient exploration in existing state-of-the-art algorithms such as Soft Actor Critic. First, combining a greedy actor update with a pessimistic estimate of the critic leads to the avoidance of actions that the agent does not know about, a phenomenon we call pessimistic underexploration. Second, current algorithms are directionally uninformed, sampling actions with equal probability in opposite directions from the current mean. This is wasteful, since we typically need actions taken along certain directions much more than others. To address both of these phenomena, we introduce a new algorithm, Optimistic Actor Critic, which approximates a lower and upper confidence bound on the state-action value function. This allows us to apply the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty to perform directed exploration using the upper bound while still using the lower bound to avoid overestimation. We evaluate OAC in several challenging continuous control tasks, achieving state-of the art sample efficiency.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/a34bacf839b923770b2c360eefa26748-Paper.pdf,2019,"actor, critic, state, actions, art, bound, achieving, address, algorithms, challenging","policy, oac, exploration, critic, bound, actor, state, target, lower, uncertainty","{'critic': 0.4690952091937787, 'optimistic': 0.4690952091937787, 'actor': 0.4562416533176019, 'better': 0.44537412667208576, 'exploration': 0.39164372903442235}","{'actor': 0.3296929097900948, 'critic': 0.3296929097900948, 'pessimistic': 0.2175051495232955, 'actions': 0.21064118295125508, 'phenomena': 0.17299036285934005, 'directions': 0.1614698878533585, 'bound': 0.15191395441993585, 'state': 0.1358490061871788, 'exploration': 0.1297597839313714, 'achieving': 0.12656126908977924}"
Algorithmic Analysis and Statistical Estimation of SLOPE via Approximate Message Passing,"Zhiqi Bu, Jason Klusowski, Cynthia Rush, Weijie Su","SLOPE is a relatively new convex optimization procedure for high-dimensional linear regression via the sorted $\ell_1$ penalty: the larger the rank of the fitted coefficient, the larger the penalty. This non-separable penalty renders many existing techniques invalid or inconclusive in analyzing the SLOPE solution. In this paper, we develop an asymptotically exact characterization of the SLOPE solution under Gaussian random designs through solving the SLOPE problem using approximate message passing (AMP). This algorithmic approach allows us to approximate the SLOPE solution via the much more amenable AMP iterates. Explicitly, we characterize the asymptotic dynamics of the AMP iterates relying on a recently developed state evolution analysis for non-separable penalties, thereby overcoming the difficulty caused by the sorted $\ell_1$ penalty. Moreover, we prove that the AMP iterates converge to the SLOPE solution in an asymptotic sense, and numerical simulations show that the convergence is surprisingly fast. Our proof rests on a novel technique that specifically leverages the SLOPE problem. In contrast to prior literature, our work not only yields an asymptotically sharp analysis but also offers an algorithmic, flexible, and constructive approach to understanding the SLOPE problem.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/a35fe7f7fe8217b4369a0af4244d1fca-Paper.pdf,2019,"slope, amp, penalty, solution, iterates, problem, algorithmic, analysis, approach, approximate","amp, slope, theorem, non, algorithm, deﬁned, lasso, solution, gaussian, proof","{'message': 0.4120037455127078, 'passing': 0.4120037455127078, 'slope': 0.4120037455127078, 'algorithmic': 0.3438226891695109, 'statistical': 0.32441081712311653, 'approximate': 0.30234356252161254, 'analysis': 0.2594321283053134, 'estimation': 0.25175398958420275, 'via': 0.21261606460803867}","{'slope': 0.6639266686503434, 'amp': 0.3319633343251717, 'penalty': 0.26138717843287573, 'iterates': 0.19004408792125246, 'solution': 0.16407192952680477, 'sorted': 0.15078391921171325, 'separable': 0.1355861712608406, 'ell_1': 0.12860384532012953, 'asymptotically': 0.10734904439938024, 'algorithmic': 0.10660572861889295}"

One ticket to win them all: generalizing lottery ticket initializations across datasets and optimizers,"Ari Morcos, Haonan Yu, Michela Paganini, Yuandong Tian","The success of lottery ticket initializations (Frankle and Carbin, 2019) suggests that small, sparsified networks can be trained so long as the network is initialized appropriately. Unfortunately, finding these ""winning ticket'' initializations is computationally expensive. One potential solution is to reuse the same winning tickets across a variety of datasets and optimizers. However, the generality of winning ticket initializations remains unclear. Here, we attempt to answer this question by generating winning tickets for one training configuration (optimizer and dataset) and evaluating their performance on another configuration. Perhaps surprisingly, we found that, within the natural images domain, winning ticket initializations generalized across a variety of datasets, including Fashion MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet, and Places365, often achieving performance close to that of winning tickets generated on the same dataset. Moreover, winning tickets generated using larger datasets consistently transferred better than those generated using smaller datasets.

Learning Distributions Generated by One-Layer ReLU Networks,"Shanshan Wu, Alexandros G. Dimakis, Sujay Sanghavi","We consider the problem of estimating the parameters of a $d$-dimensional rectified Gaussian distribution from i.i.d. samples. A rectified Gaussian distribution is defined by passing a standard Gaussian distribution through a one-layer ReLU neural network. We give a simple algorithm to estimate the parameters (i.e., the weight matrix and bias vector of the ReLU neural network) up to an error $\eps\norm{W}_F$ using $\widetilde{O}(1/\eps^2)$ samples and $\widetilde{O}(d^2/\eps^2)$ time (log factors are ignored for simplicity). This implies that we can estimate the distribution up to $\eps$ in total variation distance using $\widetilde{O}(\kappa^2d^2/\eps^2)$ samples, where $\kappa$ is the condition number of the covariance matrix. Our only assumption is that the bias vector is non-negative. Without this non-negativity assumption, we show that estimating the bias vector within any error requires the number of samples at least exponential in the infinity norm of the bias vector. Our algorithm is based on the key observation that vector norms and pairwise angles can be estimated separately. We use a recent result on learning from truncated samples. We also prove two sample complexity lower bounds: $\Omega(1/\eps^2)$ samples are required to estimate the parameters up to error $\eps$, while $\Omega(d/\eps^2)$ samples are necessary to estimate the distribution up to $\eps$ in total variation distance.

Symmetry-adapted generation of 3d point sets for the targeted discovery of molecules,"Niklas Gebauer, Michael Gastegger, Kristof Schütt","Deep learning has proven to yield fast and accurate predictions of quantum-chemical properties to accelerate the discovery of novel molecules and materials. As an exhaustive exploration of the vast chemical space is still infeasible, we require generative models that guide our search towards systems with desired properties. While graph-based models have previously been proposed, they are restricted by a lack of spatial information such that they are unable to recognize spatial isomerism and non-bonded interactions. Here, we introduce a generative neural network for 3d point sets that respects the rotational invariance of the targeted structures. We apply it to the generation of molecules and demonstrate its ability to approximate the distribution of equilibrium structures using spatial metrics as well as established measures from chemoinformatics.

Quantum Entropy Scoring for Fast Robust Mean Estimation and Improved Outlier Detection,"Yihe Dong, Samuel Hopkins, Jerry Li","We study two problems in high-dimensional robust statistics: \emph{robust mean estimation} and \emph{outlier detection}.
In robust mean estimation the goal is to estimate the mean $\mu$ of a distribution on $\mathbb{R}^d$ given $n$ independent samples, an $\epsilon$-fraction of which have been corrupted by a malicious adversary.
In outlier detection the goal is to assign an \emph{outlier score} to each element of a data set such that elements more likely to be outliers are assigned higher scores.
Our algorithms for both problems are based on a new outlier scoring method we call QUE-scoring based on \emph{quantum entropy regularization}.
For robust mean estimation, this yields the first algorithm with optimal error rates and nearly-linear running time $\tilde{O}(nd)$ in all parameters, improving on the previous fastest running time $\tilde{O}(\min(nd/\e^6, nd^2))$.
For outlier detection, we evaluate the performance of QUE-scoring via extensive experiments on synthetic and real data, and demonstrate that it often performs better than previously proposed algorithms.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/a4d92e2cd541fca87e4620aba658316d-Paper.pdf,2019,"outlier, emph, mean, robust, detection, estimation, nd, scoring, algorithms, based","outlier, mean, xi, wt, outliers, que, robust, time, algorithm, data","{'scoring': 0.40650729588310724, 'quantum': 0.35730387565369787, 'outlier': 0.34751348504539786, 'entropy': 0.33923582773168026, 'improved': 0.3200829251196207, 'mean': 0.3200829251196207, 'detection': 0.275356970612953, 'fast': 0.2629095761020541, 'estimation': 0.2483953960328782, 'robust': 0.2443150682695488}","{'outlier': 0.48757818149139187, 'nd': 0.29254690889483514, 'scoring': 0.29254690889483514, 'emph': 0.25278187192913976, 'mean': 0.24537831711856484, 'que': 0.22188853980612266, 'robust': 0.2042501394811379, 'detection': 0.18478531659317085, 'estimation': 0.15827381803825277, 'running': 0.14453550608300636}"

In this paper, we study low-rank matrix factorization in the distributed setting, where local variables at each node encode parts of the overall matrix factors, and consensus is encouraged among certain such variables. We identify conditions under which this new problem also has a well-behaved geometric landscape, and we propose an extension of distributed gradient descent (DGD) to solve this problem.

Tensor Monte Carlo: Particle Methods for the GPU era,Laurence Aitchison,"Multi-sample, importance-weighted variational autoencoders (IWAE) give tighter bounds and more accurate uncertainty estimates than variational autoencoders (VAEs) trained with a standard single-sample objective.  However, IWAEs scale poorly: as the latent dimensionality grows, they require exponentially many samples to retain the benefits of importance weighting.  While sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC) can address this problem, it is prohibitively slow because the resampling step imposes sequential structure which cannot be parallelised, and moreover, resampling is non-differentiable which is problematic when learning approximate posteriors.  To address these issues, we developed tensor Monte-Carlo (TMC) which gives exponentially many importance samples by separately drawing $K$ samples for each of the $n$ latent variables, then averaging over all $K^n$ possible combinations.  While the sum over exponentially many terms might seem to be intractable, in many cases it can be computed efficiently as a series of tensor inner-products.  We show that TMC is superior to IWAE on a generative model with multiple stochastic layers trained on the MNIST handwritten digit database, and we show that TMC can be combined with standard variance reduction techniques.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/a6197a578fe7778e8d49a95ac425bcfc-Paper.pdf,2019,"many, exponentially, importance, samples, tmc, address, autoencoders, carlo, iwae, latent","tmc, iwae, zi, factorised, samples, al, et, model, marginal, likelihood","{'era': 0.4378978958055719, 'gpu': 0.4378978958055719, 'particle': 0.4144437295232259, 'tensor': 0.35089440115197484, 'carlo': 0.34479981248228064, 'monte': 0.34479981248228064, 'methods': 0.28952816550648275}","{'tmc': 0.3594478991334123, 'iwae': 0.23963193275560818, 'exponentially': 0.23247379751608155, 'resampling': 0.21769055948675894, 'importance': 0.20208350182278836, 'many': 0.17258118676969883, 'autoencoders': 0.16519982993599877, 'tensor': 0.1609729323724581, 'samples': 0.16015608088495517, 'carlo': 0.15287143553110333}"
Learning Mixtures of Plackett-Luce Models from Structured Partial Orders,"Zhibing Zhao, Lirong Xia","Mixtures of ranking models have been widely used for heterogeneous preferences. However, learning a mixture model is highly nontrivial, especially when the dataset consists of partial orders. In such cases, the parameter of the model may not be even identifiable. In this paper, we focus on three popular structures of partial orders: ranked top-$l_1$, $l_2$-way, and choice data over a subset of alternatives. We prove that when the dataset consists of combinations of ranked top-$l_1$ and $l_2$-way (or choice data over up to $l_2$ alternatives), mixture of $k$ Plackett-Luce models is not identifiable when $l_1+l_2\le 2k-1$ ($l_2$ is set to $1$ when there are no $l_2$-way orders). We also prove that under some combinations, including ranked top-$3$, ranked top-$2$ plus $2$-way, and choice data over up to $4$ alternatives, mixtures of two Plackett-Luce models are identifiable. Guided by our theoretical results, we propose efficient generalized method of moments (GMM) algorithms to learn mixtures of two Plackett-Luce models, which are proven consistent. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms.

Combining Generative and Discriminative Models for Hybrid Inference,"Victor Garcia Satorras, Zeynep Akata, Max Welling","A graphical model is a structured representation of the data generating process. The traditional method to reason over random variables is to perform inference in this graphical model. However, in many cases the generating process is only a poor approximation of the much more complex true data generating process, leading to suboptimal estimation. The subtleties of the generative process are however captured in the data itself and we can ``learn to infer'', that is, learn a direct mapping from observations to explanatory latent variables. In this work we propose a hybrid model that combines graphical inference with a learned inverse model, which we structure as in a graph neural network, while the iterative algorithm as a whole is formulated as a recurrent neural network. By using cross-validation we can automatically balance the amount of work performed by graphical inference versus learned inference.

Trust Region-Guided Proximal Policy Optimization,"Yuhui Wang, Hao He, Xiaoyang Tan, Yaozhong Gan","Proximal policy optimization (PPO) is one of the most popular deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of challenging tasks. However, as a model-free RL method, the success of PPO relies heavily on the effectiveness of its exploratory policy search. In this paper, we give an in-depth analysis on the exploration behavior of PPO, and show that PPO is prone to suffer from the risk of lack of exploration especially under the case of bad initialization, which may lead to the failure of training or being trapped in bad local optima. To address these issues, we proposed a novel policy optimization method, named Trust Region-Guided PPO (TRGPPO), which adaptively adjusts the clipping range within the trust region.

    and most segmentation models use a pixel-wise loss as their optimization criterion.
    However, the pixel-wise loss ignores the dependencies between pixels in an image.
    Several ways to exploit the relationship between pixels have been investigated,
    \eg, conditional random fields (CRF) and pixel affinity based methods.
    Nevertheless, these methods usually require additional model
    branches, large extra memories, or more inference time.
    In this paper, we develop a region mutual information (RMI) loss
    to model the dependencies among pixels more simply and efficiently.
    In contrast to the pixel-wise loss which treats the pixels as independent samples,
    RMI uses one pixel and its neighbour pixels to represent this pixel.
    Then for each pixel in an image,
    we get a multi-dimensional point that encodes the relationship between pixels,
    and the image is cast into a multi-dimensional distribution of
    these high-dimensional points.
    The prediction and ground truth thus can achieve high order consistency
    through maximizing the mutual information (MI) between their multi-dimensional distributions.
    Moreover, as the actual value of the MI is hard to calculate,
    we derive a lower bound of the MI and maximize the lower bound to maximize the
    real value of the MI.
    RMI only requires a few extra computational resources in the training stage,
    and there is no overhead during testing.
    Experimental results demonstrate
    that RMI can achieve substantial and consistent improvements in performance on PASCAL VOC 2012 and CamVid datasets.

A Stochastic Composite Gradient Method with Incremental Variance Reduction,"Junyu Zhang, Lin Xiao","We consider the problem of minimizing the composition of a smooth (nonconvex) function and a smooth vector mapping, where the inner mapping is in the form of an expectation over some random variable or a finite sum. We propose a stochastic composite gradient method that employs incremental variance-reduced estimators for both the inner vector mapping and its Jacobian. We show that this method achieves the same orders of complexity as the best known first-order methods for minimizing expected-value and finite-sum nonconvex functions, despite the additional outer composition which renders the composite gradient estimator biased. This finding enables a much broader range of applications in machine learning to benefit from the low complexity of incremental variance-reduction methods.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/a68259547f3d25ab3c0a5c0adb4e3498-Paper.pdf,2019,"mapping, complexity, composite, composition, finite, gradient, incremental, inner, method, methods","xt, civr, problem, algorithm, sample, gradient, complexity, composite, bt, xk","{'composite': 0.44738249388869417, 'incremental': 0.44738249388869417, 'reduction': 0.38403891213614455, 'variance': 0.36769725182264335, 'method': 0.3641513237963391, 'stochastic': 0.3050852159475929, 'gradient': 0.3022043640962385}","{'mapping': 0.33468716552299105, 'incremental': 0.25735550735849494, 'composite': 0.24374695354256304, 'composition': 0.23574729759318405, 'inner': 0.2333750099936988, 'nonconvex': 0.22898368486046397, 'minimizing': 0.19753828174315674, 'sum': 0.19652957910001614, 'variance': 0.18754388991256196, 'smooth': 0.1836584650383065}"
An adaptive nearest neighbor rule for classification,"Akshay Balsubramani, Sanjoy Dasgupta, yoav Freund, Shay Moran","We introduce a variant of the $k$-nearest neighbor classifier in which $k$ is chosen adaptively for each query, rather than supplied as a parameter. The choice of $k$ depends on properties of each neighborhood, and therefore may significantly vary between different points. (For example, the algorithm will use larger $k$ for predicting the labels of points in noisy regions.)  

We provide theory and experiments that demonstrate that the algorithm performs comparably to, and sometimes better than, $k$-NN with an optimal choice of $k$. In particular, we derive bounds on the convergence rates of our classifier that depend on a local quantity we call the ``advantage'' which is significantly weaker than the Lipschitz conditions used in previous convergence rate proofs.

Variational Graph Recurrent Neural Networks,"Ehsan Hajiramezanali, Arman Hasanzadeh, Krishna Narayanan, Nick Duffield, Mingyuan Zhou, Xiaoning Qian","Representation learning over graph structured data has been mostly studied in static graph settings while efforts for modeling dynamic graphs are still scant. In this paper, we develop a novel hierarchical variational model that introduces additional latent random variables to jointly model the hidden states of a graph recurrent neural network (GRNN) to capture both topology and node attribute changes in dynamic graphs. We argue that the use of high-level latent random variables in this variational GRNN (VGRNN) can better capture potential variability observed in dynamic graphs as well as the uncertainty of node latent representation. With semi-implicit variational inference developed for this new VGRNN architecture (SI-VGRNN), we show that flexible non-Gaussian latent representations can further help dynamic graph analytic tasks.

Stochastic Bandits with Context Distributions,"Johannes Kirschner, Andreas Krause","We introduce a stochastic contextual bandit model where at each time step the environment chooses a distribution over a context set and samples the context from this distribution. The learner observes only the context distribution while the exact context realization remains hidden. This allows for a broad range of applications where the context is stochastic or when the learner needs to predict the context. We leverage the UCB algorithm to this setting and show that it achieves an order-optimal high-probability bound on the cumulative regret for linear and kernelized reward functions. Our results strictly generalize previous work in the sense that both our model and the algorithm reduce to the standard setting when the environment chooses only Dirac delta distributions and therefore provides the exact context to the learner. We further analyze a variant where the learner observes the realized context after choosing the action.

The benefits of GAN fine-tuning for language generation are unclear, as the resulting models produce comparable or worse samples than traditional language models. We show it is in fact possible to train a language GAN from scratch --- without maximum likelihood pre-training. We combine existing techniques such as large batch sizes, dense rewards and discriminator regularization to stabilize and improve language GANs.

Generalization Bounds in the Predict-then-Optimize Framework,"Othman El Balghiti, Adam N. Elmachtoub, Paul Grigas, Ambuj Tewari","The predict-then-optimize framework is fundamental in many practical settings: predict the unknown parameters of an optimization problem, and then solve the problem using the predicted values of the parameters. A natural loss function in this environment is to consider the cost of the decisions induced by the predicted parameters, in contrast to the prediction error of the parameters. This loss function was recently introduced in [Elmachtoub and Grigas, 2017], which called it the Smart Predict-then-Optimize (SPO) loss. Since the SPO loss is nonconvex and noncontinuous, standard results for deriving generalization bounds do not apply. In this work, we provide an assortment of generalization bounds for the SPO loss function. In particular, we derive bounds based on the Natarajan dimension that, in the case of a polyhedral feasible region, scale at most logarithmically in the number of extreme points, but, in the case of a general convex set, have poor dependence on the dimension. By exploiting the structure of the SPO loss function and an additional strong convexity assumption on the feasible region, we can dramatically improve the dependence on the dimension via an analysis and corresponding bounds that are akin to the margin guarantees in classification problems.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/a70145bf8b173e4496b554ce57969e24-Paper.pdf,2019,"loss, bounds, function, parameters, spo, dimension, predict, case, dependence, feasible","spo, loss, margin, rd, vector, bounds, convex, cost, function, generalization","{'optimize': 0.5539369151659649, 'predict': 0.5003465509779051, 'framework': 0.3900096883570266, 'bounds': 0.381247731749701, 'generalization': 0.381247731749701}","{'spo': 0.4788043021794304, 'loss': 0.311157391532493, 'bounds': 0.2044762415522167, 'predict': 0.20364683472160916, 'dimension': 0.20019538304149495, 'parameters': 0.19818547429033223, 'feasible': 0.17786399406468065, 'predicted': 0.17172393497211516, 'function': 0.1709390089311075, 'region': 0.15272484800113664}"

Manifold denoising by Nonlinear Robust Principal Component Analysis,"He Lyu, Ningyu Sha, Shuyang Qin, Ming Yan, Yuying Xie, Rongrong Wang",This paper extends robust principal component analysis (RPCA) to nonlinear manifolds. Suppose that the observed data matrix is the sum of a sparse component and a component drawn from some low dimensional manifold. Is it possible to separate them by using similar ideas as RPCA?

We answer these two questions affirmatively by proposing and analyzing an optimization framework that separates the sparse component from the manifold under noisy data. Theoretical error bounds are provided when the tangent spaces of the manifold satisfy certain incoherence conditions.

Foundations of Comparison-Based Hierarchical Clustering,"Debarghya Ghoshdastidar, Michaël Perrot, Ulrike von Luxburg","We address the classical problem of hierarchical clustering, but in a framework where one does not have access to a representation of the objects or their pairwise similarities. Instead, we assume that only a set of comparisons between objects is available, that is, statements of the form ``objects i and j are more similar than objects k and l.'' Such a scenario is commonly encountered in crowdsourcing applications. The focus of this work is to develop comparison-based hierarchical clustering algorithms that do not rely on the principles of ordinal embedding.

On the Accuracy of Influence Functions for Measuring Group Effects,"Pang Wei W. Koh, Kai-Siang Ang, Hubert Teo, Percy S. Liang","Influence functions estimate the effect of removing a training point on a model without the need to retrain. They are based on a first-order Taylor approximation that is guaranteed to be accurate for sufficiently small changes to the model, and so are commonly used to study the effect of individual points in large datasets. However, we often want to study the effects of large groups of training points, e.g., to diagnose batch effects or apportion credit between different data sources. Removing such large groups can result in significant changes to the model. Are influence functions still accurate in this setting? In this paper, we find that across many different types of groups and for a range of real-world datasets, the predicted effect (using influence functions) of a group correlates surprisingly well with its actual effect, even if the absolute and relative errors are large. Our theoretical analysis shows that such strong correlation arises only under certain settings and need not hold in general, indicating that real-world datasets have particular properties that allow the influence approximation to be accurate.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/a78482ce76496fcf49085f2190e675b4-Paper.pdf,2019,"effect, influence, large, accurate, datasets, functions, groups, model, approximation, changes","inﬂuence, points, test, actual, effect, al, et, loss, effects, model","{'influence': 0.4456820977171966, 'measuring': 0.4194049981828101, 'accuracy': 0.40941490858912394, 'group': 0.40941490858912394, 'effects': 0.4007610993591968, 'functions': 0.3600226684029811}","{'influence': 0.41114440630278803, 'effect': 0.3121589569648812, 'groups': 0.2609572031436649, 'accurate': 0.21923699021042845, 'removing': 0.20228517691420922, 'large': 0.18829856050141391, 'effects': 0.16545783931865965, 'functions': 0.16396712383963, 'changes': 0.1552679664013585, 'need': 0.14155280657809793}"
Neural Similarity Learning,"Weiyang Liu, Zhen Liu, James M.

By generalizing inner product with a bilinear matrix, we propose the neural similarity which serves as a learnable parametric similarity measure for CNNs. Neural similarity naturally generalizes the convolution and enhances flexibility. Further, we consider the neural similarity learning (NSL) in order to learn the neural similarity adaptively from training data. Specifically, we propose two different ways of learning the neural similarity: static NSL and dynamic NSL. Interestingly, dynamic neural similarity makes the CNN  become a dynamic inference network. By regularizing the bilinear matrix, NSL can be viewed as learning the shape of kernel and the similarity measure simultaneously. We further justify the effectiveness of NSL with a theoretical viewpoint. Most importantly, NSL shows promising performance in visual recognition and few-shot learning, validating the superiority of NSL over the inner product-based convolution counterparts.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/a7a3d70c6d17a73140918996d03c014f-Paper.pdf,2019,"similarity, neural, nsl, learning, convolution, dynamic, inner, product, based, bilinear","similarity, neural, dynamic, nsn, matrix, learning, static, cnn, convolution, input","{'similarity': 0.8341501874510537, 'neural': 0.44365914768933173, 'learning': 0.32765839749188125}","{'nsl': 0.6318838040092206, 'similarity': 0.4438139662308271, 'neural': 0.19153230804325108, 'inner': 0.19027211851902442, 'convolution': 0.18669184342346476, 'product': 0.16945509993490934, 'dynamic': 0.15495043902881617, 'bilinear': 0.15066159061716547, 'cnns': 0.12335179184635531, 'learning': 0.09909685255866425}"

The Case for Evaluating Causal Models Using Interventional Measures and Empirical Data,"Amanda Gentzel, Dan Garant, David Jensen","Causal inference is central to many areas of artificial intelligence, including complex reasoning, planning, knowledge-base construction, robotics, explanation, and fairness. An active community of researchers develops and enhances algorithms that learn causal models from data, and this work has produced a series of impressive technical advances.  However, evaluation techniques for causal modeling algorithms have remained somewhat primitive, limiting what we can learn from experimental studies of algorithm performance, constraining the types of algorithms and model representations that researchers consider, and creating a gap between theory and practice.  We argue for more frequent use of evaluation techniques that examine interventional measures rather than structural or observational measures, and that evaluate those measures on empirical data rather than synthetic data.  We survey the current practice in evaluation and show that the techniques we recommend are rarely used in practice. We show that such techniques are feasible and that data sets are available to conduct such evaluations.

Spatially Aggregated Gaussian Processes with Multivariate Areal Outputs,"Yusuke Tanaka, Toshiyuki Tanaka, Tomoharu Iwata, Takeshi Kurashima, Maya Okawa, Yasunori Akagi, Hiroyuki Toda","We propose a probabilistic model for inferring the multivariate function from multiple areal data sets with various granularities. Here, the areal data are observed not at location points but at regions. Existing regression-based models can only utilize the sufficiently fine-grained auxiliary data sets on the same domain (e.g., a city). With the proposed model, the functions for respective areal data sets are assumed to be a multivariate dependent Gaussian process (GP) that is modeled as a linear mixing of independent latent GPs. Sharing of latent GPs across multiple areal data sets allows us to effectively estimate the spatial correlation for each areal data set; moreover it can easily be extended to transfer learning across multiple domains. To handle the multivariate areal data, we design an observation model with a spatial aggregation process for each areal data set, which is an integral of the mixed GP over the corresponding region. By deriving the posterior GP, we can predict the data value at any location point by considering the spatial correlations and the dependences between areal data sets, simultaneously. Our experiments on real-world data sets demonstrate that our model can 1) accurately refine coarse-grained areal data, and 2) offer performance improvements by using the areal data sets from multiple domains.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/a941493eeea57ede8214fd77d41806bc-Paper.pdf,2019,"data, areal, sets, model, multiple, gp, multivariate, spatial, across, domains","data, areal, sets, gp, model, x0, sagp, grained, function, spatial","{'areal': 0.43209061543247845, 'outputs': 0.43209061543247845, 'spatially': 0.43209061543247845, 'aggregated': 0.37979060423065775, 'multivariate': 0.3529637530802912, 'gaussian': 0.30667750580453706, 'processes': 0.27752061824059343}","{'areal': 0.7487121839659385, 'sets': 0.28635688163564277, 'data': 0.2641853289127777, 'gp': 0.16907571640831065, 'multivariate': 0.15346609349311838, 'spatial': 0.13572776881383822, 'multiple': 0.1343414501295393, 'gps': 0.11790685596227501, 'grained': 0.10419601758575024, 'location': 0.10323092088759908}"
First Exit Time Analysis of Stochastic Gradient Descent Under Heavy-Tailed Gradient Noise,"Thanh Huy Nguyen, Umut Simsekli, Mert Gurbuzbalaban, Gaël RICHARD","Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has been widely used in machine learning due to its computational efficiency and favorable generalization properties. Recently, it has been empirically demonstrated that the gradient noise in several deep learning settings admits a non-Gaussian, heavy-tailed behavior. This suggests that the gradient noise can be modeled by using $\alpha$-stable distributions, a family of heavy-tailed distributions that appear in the generalized central limit theorem. In this context, SGD can be viewed as a discretization of a stochastic differential equation (SDE) driven by a L\'{e}vy motion, and the metastability results for this SDE can then be used for illuminating the behavior of SGD, especially in terms of  `preferring wide minima'. While this approach brings a new perspective for analyzing SGD, it is limited in the sense that, due to the time discretization, SGD might admit a significantly different behavior than its continuous-time limit. Intuitively, the behaviors of these two systems are expected to be similar to each other only when the discretization step is sufficiently small; however, to the best of our knowledge, there is no theoretical understanding on how small the step-size should be chosen in order to guarantee that the discretized system inherits the properties of the continuous-time system. In this study, we provide formal theoretical analysis where we derive explicit conditions for the step-size such that the metastability behavior of the discrete-time system is similar to its continuous-time limit. We show that the behaviors of the two systems are indeed similar for small step-sizes and we identify how the error depends on the algorithm and problem parameters. We illustrate our results with simulations on a synthetic model and neural networks.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/a97da629b098b75c294dffdc3e463904-Paper.pdf,2019,"sgd, time, behavior, step, continuous, discretization, gradient, limit, similar, small","time, kη, 10, exit, sgd, noise, continuous, step, µt, ﬁrst","{'gradient': 0.4431439442309865, 'exit': 0.38369819878707945, 'tailed': 0.3631470122141608, 'heavy': 0.3485657132900046, 'first': 0.3074633401441672, 'noise': 0.28157190709527985, 'descent': 0.26215976761718235, 'analysis': 0.2416085810442637, 'time': 0.22819251648629438, 'stochastic': 0.22368417201037594}","{'sgd': 0.31720699636369615, 'discretization': 0.25992746973331654, 'behavior': 0.22690926603034195, 'metastability': 0.20764790392482316, 'step': 0.19748790145141268, 'limit': 0.1973949017154733, 'sde': 0.19652611386032878, 'time': 0.17393740111777506, 'tailed': 0.17328497982221105, 'system': 0.1663812895392712}"

Here, we demonstrate a coupled convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network architecture that extracts the wind speed encoded in visually recorded flow-structure interactions of a flag and tree in naturally occurring wind. Predictions for wind speeds ranging from 0.75-11 m/s showed agreement with measurements from a cup anemometer on site, with a root-mean-squared error approaching the natural wind speed variability due to atmospheric turbulence. Generalizability of the network was demonstrated by successful prediction of wind speed based on recordings of other flags in the field and in a controlled wind tunnel test.

However, this Optimal Transport (OT) distance requires solving a complex non convex quadratic program which is most of the time very costly both in time and memory. 
Contrary to GW, the Wasserstein distance (W) enjoys several properties ({\em e.g.} duality) that permit large scale optimization. Among those, the solution of W on the real line, that only requires sorting
discrete samples in 1D, allows defining the Sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance. This paper proposes a new divergence based on GW akin to SW. 
We first derive a closed form for GW when dealing with 1D distributions, based on a
 new result for the related quadratic assignment problem. 
We then define a novel OT discrepancy that can deal with large scale distributions via a slicing approach and we show how it relates to the GW distance while being $O(n\log(n))$ to compute. We illustrate the behavior of this 
so called Sliced Gromov-Wasserstein (SGW) discrepancy in experiments where we demonstrate its ability to tackle similar problems as GW while being several order of magnitudes

Sparse Logistic Regression Learns All Discrete Pairwise Graphical Models,"Shanshan Wu, Sujay Sanghavi, Alexandros G. Dimakis","We characterize the effectiveness of a classical algorithm for recovering the Markov graph of a general discrete pairwise graphical model from i.i.d. samples. The algorithm is (appropriately regularized) maximum conditional log-likelihood, which involves solving a convex program for each node; for Ising models this is $\ell_1$-constrained logistic regression, while for more general alphabets an $\ell_{2,1}$ group-norm constraint needs to be used. We show that this algorithm can recover any arbitrary discrete pairwise graphical model, and also characterize its sample complexity as a function of model width, alphabet size, edge parameter accuracy, and the number of variables. We show that along every one of these axes, it matches or improves on all existing results and algorithms for this problem. Our analysis applies a sharp generalization error bound for logistic regression when the weight vector has an $\ell_1$ (or $\ell_{2,1}$) constraint and the sample vector has an $\ell_{\infty}$ (or $\ell_{2, \infty}$) constraint.

Coordinated hippocampal-entorhinal replay as structural inference,"Talfan Evans, Neil Burgess","Constructing and maintaining useful representations of sensory experience is essential for reasoning about ones environment. High-level associative (topological) maps can be useful for efficient planning and are easily constructed from experience. Conversely, embedding new experiences within a metric structure allows them to be integrated with existing ones and novel associations to be implicitly inferred. Neurobiologically, the synaptic associations between hippocampal place cells and entorhinal grid cells are thought to represent associative and metric structures, respectively. Learning the place-grid cell associations can therefore be interpreted as learning a mapping between these two spaces. Here, we show how this map could be constructed by probabilistic message-passing through the hippocampal-entorhinal system, where messages are scheduled to reduce the propagation of redundant information. We propose that this offline inference corresponds to coordinated hippocampal-entorhinal replay during sharp wave ripples. Our results also suggest that the metric map will contain local distortions that reflect the inferred structure of the environment according to associative experience, explaining observed grid deformations.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/aa68c75c4a77c87f97fb686b2f068676-Paper.pdf,2019,"associations, associative, entorhinal, experience, grid, hippocampal, metric, cells, constructed, environment","fig, sensory, location, pc, structure, gc, learning, metric, space, grid","{'coordinated': 0.45345693100700896, 'entorhinal': 0.45345693100700896, 'hippocampal': 0.45345693100700896, 'replay': 0.38764961910437556, 'structural': 0.38764961910437556, 'inference': 0.2873777666792948}","{'entorhinal': 0.31567839251195895, 'associative': 0.2987704019035579, 'hippocampal': 0.2987704019035579, 'associations': 0.286773991652833, 'grid': 0.25295801043603106, 'experience': 0.20006078907545546, 'metric': 0.17981499868465226, 'place': 0.1756252542333945, 'cells': 0.16570963472751213, 'inferred': 0.16570963472751213}"
A Linearly Convergent Method for Non-Smooth Non-Convex Optimization on the Grassmannian with Applications to Robust Subspace and Dictionary Learning,"Zhihui Zhu, Tianyu Ding, Daniel Robinson, Manolis Tsakiris, René Vidal","Minimizing  a non-smooth function over the Grassmannian appears in many applications in machine learning.

We show that for both the robust subspace learning method Dual Principal Component Pursuit (DPCP) and the Orthogonal Dictionary Learning (ODL) problem, the Riemannian regularity condition is satisfied with respect to appropriate points of interest, namely the subspace orthogonal to the sought subspace for DPCP and the orthonormal dictionary atoms for ODL.

Finite-time Analysis of Approximate Policy Iteration for the Linear Quadratic Regulator,"Karl Krauth, Stephen Tu, Benjamin Recht","We study the sample complexity of approximate policy iteration (PI) for the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), building on a recent line of work using LQR as a testbed to understand the limits of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms on continuous control tasks. Our analysis quantifies the tension between policy improvement and policy evaluation, and suggests that policy evaluation is the dominant factor in terms of sample complexity. Specifically, we show that to obtain a controller that is within $\varepsilon$ of the optimal LQR controller, each step of policy evaluation requires at most $(n+d)^3/\varepsilon^2$ samples, where $n$ is the dimension of the state vector and $d$ is the dimension of the input vector. On the other hand, only $\log(1/\varepsilon)$ policy improvement steps suffice, resulting in an overall sample complexity of $(n+d)^3 \varepsilon^{-2} \log(1/\varepsilon)$.

The Impact of Regularization on High-dimensional Logistic Regression,"Fariborz Salehi, Ehsan Abbasi, Babak Hassibi","Logistic regression is commonly used for modeling dichotomous outcomes. In the classical setting, where the number of observations is much larger than the number of parameters, properties of the maximum likelihood estimator in logistic regression are well understood. Recently, Sur and Candes~\cite{sur2018modern} have studied logistic regression in the high-dimensional regime, where the number of observations and parameters are comparable, and show, among other things, that the maximum likelihood estimator is biased. In the high-dimensional regime the underlying parameter vector is often structured (sparse, block-sparse, finite-alphabet, etc.) and so in this paper we study regularized logistic regression (RLR), where a convex regularizer that encourages the desired structure is added to the negative of the log-likelihood function. An advantage of RLR is that it allows parameter recovery even for instances where the (unconstrained) maximum likelihood estimate does not exist. We provide a precise analysis of the performance of RLR via the solution of a system of six nonlinear equations, through which any performance metric of interest (mean, mean-squared error, probability of support recovery, etc.) can be explicitly computed. Our results generalize those of Sur and Candes and we provide a detailed study for the cases of $\ell_2^2$-RLR and sparse ($\ell_1$-regularized) logistic regression. In both cases, we obtain explicit expressions for various performance metrics and can find the values of the regularizer parameter that optimizes the desired performance. The theory is validated by extensive numerical simulations across a range of parameter values and problem instances.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/ab49ef78e2877bfd2c2bfa738e459bf0-Paper.pdf,2019,"logistic, regression, likelihood, parameter, performance, rlr, maximum, number, sparse, candes","performance, function, logistic, nonlinear, regression, system, estimate, equations, result, solution","{'impact': 0.49464700106295645, 'logistic': 0.46548296564871644, 'dimensional': 0.3905739362885786, 'regularization': 0.38257376982182417, 'regression': 0.3473618576383363, 'high': 0.3450782575369056}","{'rlr': 0.38201436011235695, 'logistic': 0.3425251654785925, 'regression': 0.23739828537157895, 'likelihood': 0.21209040219976732, 'parameter': 0.19586231741880158, 'candes': 0.19100718005617848, 'sur': 0.19100718005617848, 'maximum': 0.16039591245114126, 'sparse': 0.1446022613817442, 'regularizer': 0.1401681220483246}"
Why Can't I Dance in the Mall? Learning to Mitigate Scene Bias in Action Recognition,"Jinwoo Choi, Chen Gao, Joseph C. E. Messou, Jia-Bin Huang","Human activities often occur in specific scene contexts, e.g., playing basketball on a basketball court. Training a model using existing video datasets thus inevitably captures and leverages such bias (instead of using the actual discriminative cues). The learned representation may not generalize well to new action classes or different tasks. In this paper, we propose to mitigate scene bias for video representation learning. Specifically, we augment the standard cross-entropy loss for action classification with 1) an adversarial loss for scene types and 2) a human mask confusion loss for videos where the human actors are masked out. These two losses encourage learning representations that are unable to predict the scene types and the correct actions when there is no evidence. We validate the effectiveness of our method by transferring our pre-trained model to three different tasks, including action classification, temporal localization, and spatio-temporal action detection.

Cross-sectional Learning of Extremal Dependence among Financial Assets,"Xing Yan, Qi Wu, Wen Zhang","We propose a novel probabilistic model to facilitate the learning of multivariate tail dependence of multiple financial assets. Our method allows one to construct from known random vectors, e.g., standard normal, sophisticated joint heavy-tailed random vectors featuring not only distinct marginal tail heaviness, but also flexible tail dependence structure. The novelty lies in that pairwise tail dependence between any two dimensions is modeled separately from their correlation, and can vary respectively according to its own parameter rather than the correlation parameter, which is an essential advantage over many commonly used methods such as multivariate $t$ or elliptical distribution. It is also intuitive to interpret, easy to track, and simple to sample comparing to the copula approach. We show its flexible tail dependence structure through simulation. Coupled with a GARCH model to eliminate serial dependence of each individual asset return series, we use this novel method to model and forecast multivariate conditional distribution of stock returns, and obtain notable performance improvements in multi-dimensional coverage tests.

Metamers of neural networks reveal divergence from human perceptual systems,"Jenelle Feather, Alex Durango, Ray Gonzalez, Josh McDermott","Deep neural networks have been embraced as models of sensory systems, instantiating representational transformations that appear to resemble those in the visual and auditory systems. To more thoroughly investigate their similarity to biological systems, we synthesized model metamers – stimuli that produce the same responses at some stage of a network’s representation. We generated model metamers for natural stimuli by performing gradient descent on a noise signal, matching the responses of individual layers of image and audio networks to a natural image or speech signal. The resulting signals reflect the invariances instantiated in the network up to the matched layer. We then measured whether model metamers were recognizable to human observers – a necessary condition for the model representations to replicate those of humans. Although model metamers from early network layers were recognizable to humans, those from deeper layers were not. Auditory model metamers became more human-recognizable with architectural modifications that reduced aliasing from pooling operations, but those from the deepest layers remained unrecognizable. We also used the metamer test to compare model representations. Cross-model metamer recognition dropped off for deeper layers, roughly at the same point that human recognition deteriorated, indicating divergence across model representations. The results reveal discrepancies between model and human representations, but also show how metamers can help guide model refinement and elucidate model representations.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/ac27b77292582bc293a51055bfc994ee-Paper.pdf,2019,"model, metamers, layers, representations, human, network, recognizable, systems, also, auditory","metamers, model, network, human, networks, trained, models, layer, metamer, layers","{'metamers': 0.43617686559158864, 'reveal': 0.43617686559158864, 'divergence': 0.39623928586617635, 'perceptual': 0.39623928586617635, 'systems': 0.349515312848321, 'human': 0.3379531192430619, 'networks': 0.18589657850044558, 'neural': 0.18589657850044558}","{'metamers': 0.5212262113768107, 'model': 0.26924522538463974, 'recognizable': 0.26061310568840534, 'layers': 0.23118517017464646, 'representations': 0.19663408700845422, 'human': 0.1764685292500053, 'metamer': 0.1737420704589369, 'auditory': 0.15271242550324848, 'stimuli': 0.14192544588302863, 'systems': 0.12956393454443496}"
Optimal Sparse Decision Trees,"Xiyang Hu, Cynthia Rudin, Margo Seltzer","Decision tree algorithms have been among the most popular algorithms for interpretable (transparent) machine learning since the early 1980's. The problem that has plagued decision tree algorithms since their inception is their lack of optimality, or lack of guarantees of closeness to optimality: decision tree algorithms are often greedy or myopic, and sometimes produce unquestionably suboptimal models. Hardness of decision tree optimization is both a theoretical and practical obstacle, and even careful mathematical programming approaches have not been able to solve these problems efficiently. This work introduces the first practical algorithm for optimal decision trees for binary variables. The algorithm is a co-design of analytical bounds that reduce the search space and modern systems techniques, including data structures and a custom bit-vector library.

Distinguishing Distributions When Samples Are Strategically Transformed,"Hanrui Zhang, Yu Cheng, Vincent Conitzer","Often, a principal must make a decision based on data provided by an agent.  Moreover, typically, that agent has an interest in the decision that is not perfectly aligned with that of the principal.  Thus, the agent may have an incentive to select from or modify the samples he obtains before sending them to the principal.  In other settings, the principal may not even be able to observe samples directly; instead, she must rely on signals that the agent is able to send based on the samples that he obtains, and he will choose these signals strategically.In this paper, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for when the principal can distinguish between agents ofgood'' andbad'' types, when the type affects the distribution of samples that the agent has access to.

Positive-Unlabeled Compression on the Cloud,"Yixing Xu, Yunhe Wang, Hanting Chen, Kai Han, Chunjing XU, Dacheng Tao, Chang Xu","Many attempts have been done to extend the great success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieved on high-end GPU servers to portable devices such as smart phones.

In this paper, we present a novel positive-unlabeled (PU) setting for addressing this problem. In practice, only a small portion of the original training set is required as positive examples and more useful training examples can be obtained from the massive unlabeled data on the cloud through a PU classifier with an attention based multi-scale feature extractor. We further introduce a robust knowledge distillation (RKD) scheme to deal with the class imbalance problem of these newly augmented training examples.

SSRGD: Simple Stochastic Recursive Gradient Descent for Escaping Saddle Points,Zhize Li,"We analyze stochastic gradient algorithms for optimizing nonconvex problems.
In particular, our goal is to find local minima (second-order stationary points) instead of just finding first-order stationary points which may be some bad unstable saddle points.
We show that a simple perturbed version of stochastic recursive gradient descent algorithm (called SSRGD) can find an $(\epsilon,\delta)$-second-order stationary point with $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n}/\epsilon^2 + \sqrt{n}/\delta^4 + n/\delta^3)$ stochastic gradient complexity for nonconvex finite-sum problems.
As a by-product, SSRGD finds an $\epsilon$-first-order stationary point with $O(n+\sqrt{n}/\epsilon^2)$ stochastic gradients. These results are almost optimal since Fang et al. [2018] provided a lower bound $\Omega(\sqrt{n}/\epsilon^2)$ for finding even just an $\epsilon$-first-order stationary point.
We emphasize that SSRGD algorithm for finding second-order stationary points is as simple as for finding first-order stationary points just by adding a uniform perturbation sometimes, while all other algorithms for finding second-order stationary points with similar gradient complexity need to combine with a negative-curvature search subroutine (e.g., Neon2 [Allen-Zhu and Li, 2018]).
Moreover, the simple SSRGD algorithm gets a simpler analysis.

The mounting evidence for each of the classes helps us make our final decision. In this work, we introduce a deep network architecture -- prototypical part network (ProtoPNet), that reasons in a similar way: the network dissects the image by finding prototypical parts, and combines evidence from the prototypes to make a final classification. The model thus reasons in a way that is qualitatively similar to the way ornithologists, physicians, and others would explain to people on how to solve challenging image classification tasks. The network uses only image-level labels for training without any annotations for parts of images. We demonstrate our method on the CUB-200-2011 dataset and the Stanford Cars dataset. Our experiments show that ProtoPNet can achieve comparable accuracy with its analogous non-interpretable counterpart, and when several ProtoPNets are combined into a larger network, it can achieve an accuracy that is on par with some of the best-performing deep models.

For the case where \sum{t=1}^{T}d{t} and T are unknown, we propose a novel doubling trick for online learning with delays and prove that this adaptive EXP3 achieves a regret of O\left(\sqrt{\ln K\left(K^{2}T+\sum{t=1}^{T}d{t}\right)}\right). We then consider a two player zero-sum game where players experience asynchronous delays. We show that even when the delays are large enough such that players no longer enjoy the “no-regret property”, (e.g., where d{t}=O\left(t\log t\right)) the ergodic average of the strategy profile still converges to the set of Nash equilibria of the game. The result is made possible by choosing an adaptive step size \eta{t} that is not summable but is square summable, and proving a “weighted regret bound” for this general case.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/ae2a2db40a12ec0131d48acc1218d2ef-Paper.pdf,2019,"left, right, delays, player, regret, sum, arm, feedback, achieves, adaptive","dt, pt, feedback, regret, delays, round, exp3, cost, ea, algorithm","{'exp3': 0.5212145616858431, 'delayed': 0.4932978872380909, 'feedback': 0.3872367198211803, 'bandits': 0.3395128496357654, 'online': 0.32820042175492464, 'adversarial': 0.2917889794503504, 'learning': 0.16405790904012352}","{'left': 0.3760534456870519, 'right': 0.3535034932608593, 'delays': 0.31367892978272305, 'player': 0.25070229712470127, 'sum': 0.2171052471354044, 'arm': 0.1996033831370416, 'regret': 0.18935507158995724, 'summable': 0.18346449707530632, 'feedback': 0.17675174663042964, 'exp3': 0.17363798988600995}"
Phase Transitions and Cyclic Phenomena in Bandits with Switching Constraints,"David Simchi-Levi, Yunzong Xu","We consider the classical stochastic multi-armed bandit problem with a constraint on the total cost incurred by switching between actions. Under the unit switching cost structure, where the constraint limits the total number of switches, we prove matching upper and lower bounds on regret and provide near-optimal algorithms for this problem.

That is, we show that associated with the multi-armed bandit problem, there are equal-length phases defined by the number of arms and switching costs, where the regret upper and lower bounds in each phase remain the same and drop significantly between phases. The results enable us to fully characterize the trade-off between regret and incurred switching cost in the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem, contributing new insights to this fundamental problem.

Learning Dynamics of Attention: Human Prior for Interpretable Machine Reasoning,"Wonjae Kim, Yoonho Lee","Without relevant human priors, neural networks may learn uninterpretable features.

DAFT is a novel method that regularizes attention-based reasoning by modelling it as a continuous dynamical system using neural ordinary differential equations. As a proof of concept, we augment a state-of-the-art visual reasoning model with DAFT. Our experiments reveal that applying DAFT yields similar performance to the original model while using fewer reasoning steps, showing that it implicitly learns to skip unnecessary steps. We also propose a new metric, Total Length of Transition (TLT), which represents the effective reasoning step size by quantifying how much a given model's focus drifts while reasoning about a question.

Fast Parallel Algorithms for Statistical Subset Selection Problems,"Sharon Qian, Yaron Singer","In this paper, we propose a new framework for designing fast parallel algorithms for fundamental statistical subset selection tasks that include feature selection and experimental design.  Such tasks are known to be weakly submodular and are amenable to optimization via the standard greedy algorithm.  Despite its desirable approximation guarantees, however, the greedy algorithm is inherently sequential and in the worst case, its parallel runtime is linear in the size of the data.
Recently, there has been a surge of interest in a parallel optimization technique called adaptive sampling which produces solutions with desirable approximation guarantees for submodular maximization in exponentially faster parallel runtime.  Unfortunately, we show that for general weakly submodular functions such accelerations are impossible.  The major contribution in this paper is a novel relaxation of submodularity which we call differential submodularity.  We first prove that differential submodularity characterizes objectives like feature selection and experimental design.  We then design an adaptive sampling algorithm for differentially submodular functions whose parallel runtime is logarithmic in the size of the data and achieves strong approximation guarantees.  Through experiments, we show the algorithm's performance is competitive with state-of-the-art methods and obtains dramatic speedups for feature selection and experimental design problems.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/ae587cfeea5ac21a8f1c1ea51027fef0-Paper.pdf,2019,"parallel, algorithm, design, selection, submodular, approximation, experimental, feature, guarantees, runtime","submodular, submodularity, algorithm, dash, feature, function, fs, elements, adaptive, selection","{'subset': 0.42327498810995734, 'parallel': 0.4131927166246238, 'statistical': 0.3898642848536045, 'selection': 0.38363049393435594, 'problems': 0.37793948870424454, 'algorithms': 0.3249003544966281, 'fast': 0.3202265595076211}","{'submodular': 0.35867542753973475, 'parallel': 0.35251433585551956, 'submodularity': 0.29915930688094033, 'selection': 0.2447829137333701, 'runtime': 0.23621659044685162, 'design': 0.19740945770523063, 'weakly': 0.17010230016272163, 'desirable': 0.15747772696456774, 'feature': 0.15619110351503898, 'experimental': 0.15578643824323893}"

In this work, we show that thislazy training'' phenomenon is not specific to over-parameterized neural networks, and is due to a choice of scaling, often implicit, that makes the model behave as its linearization around the initialization, thus yielding a model equivalent to learning with positive-definite kernels. Through a theoretical analysis, we exhibit various situations where this phenomenon arises in non-convex optimization and we provide bounds on the distance between the lazy and linearized optimization paths. Our numerical experiments bring a critical note, as we observe that the performance of commonly used non-linear deep convolutional neural networks in computer vision degrades when trained in the lazy regime.

Efficient Regret Minimization Algorithm for Extensive-Form Correlated Equilibrium,"Gabriele Farina, Chun Kai Ling, Fei Fang, Tuomas Sandholm","Self-play methods based on regret minimization have become the state of the art for computing Nash equilibria in large two-players zero-sum extensive-form games. These methods fundamentally rely on the hierarchical structure of the players' sequential strategy spaces to construct a regret minimizer that recursively minimizes regret at each decision point in the game tree. In this paper, we introduce the first efficient regret minimization algorithm for computing extensive-form correlated equilibria in large two-player general-sum games with no chance moves. Designing such an algorithm is significantly more challenging than designing one for the Nash equilibrium counterpart, as the constraints that define the space of correlation plans lack the hierarchical structure and might even form cycles. We show that some of the constraints are redundant and can be excluded from consideration, and present an efficient algorithm that generates the space of extensive-form correlation plans incrementally from the remaining constraints. This structural decomposition is achieved via a special convexity-preserving operation that we coin scaled extension. We show that a regret minimizer can be designed for a scaled extension of any two convex sets, and that from the decomposition we then obtain a global regret minimizer. Our algorithm produces feasible iterates. Experiments show that it significantly outperforms prior approaches and for larger problems it is the only viable option.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/aee92f16efd522b9326c25cc3237ac15-Paper.pdf,2019,"regret, algorithm, form, constraints, extensive, minimizer, show, two, computing, correlation","σ1, σ2, regret, algorithm, player, form, set, sequence, two, game","{'equilibrium': 0.4096008271244007, 'extensive': 0.4096008271244007, 'form': 0.4096008271244007, 'correlated': 0.36130128016550733, 'minimization': 0.3493491991048574, 'regret': 0.30806488865816345, 'algorithm': 0.29586719623936675, 'efficient': 0.24830754289402943}","{'regret': 0.3408778559400893, 'minimizer': 0.2697920557867073, 'form': 0.22225254982534895, 'scaled': 0.1837451955534995, 'plans': 0.17986137052447151, 'constraints': 0.17157219231618048, 'equilibria': 0.1705989899921025, 'nash': 0.1635846751264513, 'extensive': 0.16229851405570017, 'players': 0.1615779841466081}"

Towards Practical Alternating Least-Squares for CCA,"Zhiqiang Xu, Ping Li","Alternating least-squares (ALS) is a simple yet effective solver for canonical correlation analysis (CCA). In terms of ease of use, ALS is arguably practitioners' first choice. Despite recent provably guaranteed variants, the empirical performance often remains unsatisfactory. To promote the practical use of ALS for CCA,  we propose truly alternating least-squares. Instead of approximately solving two independent linear systems, in each iteration, it simply solves two coupled linear systems of half the size. It turns out that this coupling procedure is able to bring significant performance improvements in practice. Inspired by accelerated power method, we further propose faster alternating least-squares, where momentum terms are introduced into the update equations. Both algorithms enjoy linear convergence. To make faster ALS even more practical, we put forward adaptive alternating least-squares to avoid tuning the momentum parameter, which is as easy to use as the plain ALS while retaining advantages of the fast version.

Our method builds on the observation that the location of object segments can be perturbed locally relative to a given background without affecting the realism of a scene. Our approach is to first train a generative model of a layered scene. The layered representation consists of a background image, a foreground image and the mask of the foreground. A composite image is then obtained by overlaying the masked foreground image onto the background. The generative model is trained in an adversarial fashion against a discriminator, which forces the generative model to produce realistic composite images. To force the generator to learn a representation where the foreground layer corresponds to an object, we perturb the output of the generative model by introducing a random shift of both the foreground image and mask relative to the background. Because the generator is unaware of the shift before computing its output, it must produce layered representations that are realistic for any such random perturbation. Finally, we learn to segment an image by defining an autoencoder consisting of an encoder, which we train, and the pre-trained generator as the decoder, which we freeze. The encoder maps an image to a feature vector, which is fed as input to the generator to give a composite image matching the original input image. Because the generator outputs an explicit layered representation of the scene, the encoder learns to detect and segment objects. We demonstrate this framework on real images of several object categories.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/af8d9c4e238c63fb074b44eb6aed80ae-Paper.pdf,2019,"image, foreground, generator, model, background, generative, layered, composite, encoder, images","mask, image, images, object, background, generator, foreground, al, et, segmentation","{'perturbed': 0.5290321697433257, 'emergence': 0.5006967778706517, 'segmentation': 0.3882233417312515, 'object': 0.36811906125272104, 'generative': 0.3146253552858718, 'models': 0.29018886866192933}","{'foreground': 0.37300675005346134, 'image': 0.31440391035410703, 'layered': 0.30841266250639127, 'generator': 0.27072537369374, 'background': 0.263045652023748, 'segment': 0.2124867859981418, 'composite': 0.18685215924121928, 'scene': 0.16708191920857113, 'encoder': 0.15740571529807834, 'generative': 0.1499383140031875}"

Optimistic Regret Minimization for Extensive-Form Games via Dilated Distance-Generating Functions,"Gabriele Farina, Christian Kroer, Tuomas Sandholm","We study the performance of optimistic regret-minimization algorithms for both minimizing regret in, and computing Nash equilibria of, zero-sum extensive-form games. In order to apply these algorithms to extensive-form games, a distance-generating function is needed. We study the use of the dilated entropy and dilated Euclidean distance functions. For the dilated Euclidean distance function we prove the first explicit bounds on the strong-convexity parameter for general treeplexes. Furthermore, we show that the use of dilated distance-generating functions enable us to decompose the mirror descent algorithm, and its optimistic variant, into local mirror descent algorithms at each information set. This decomposition mirrors the structure of the counterfactual regret minimization framework, and enables important techniques in practice, such as distributed updates and pruning of cold parts of the game tree. Our algorithms provably converge at a rate of $T^{-1}$, which is superior to prior counterfactual regret minimization algorithms. We experimentally compare to the popular algorithm CFR+, which has a theoretical convergence rate of $T^{-0.5}$ in theory, but is known to often converge at a rate of $T^{-1}$, or better, in practice. We give an example matrix game where CFR+ experimentally converges at a relatively slow rate of $T^{-0.74}$, whereas our optimistic methods converge faster than $T^{-1}$. We go on to show that our fast rate also holds in the Kuhn poker game, which is an extensive-form game. For games with deeper game trees however, we find that CFR+ is still faster. Finally we show that when the goal is minimizing regret, rather than computing a Nash equilibrium, our optimistic methods can outperform CFR+, even in deep game trees.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/b030afbb3a8af8fb0759241c97466ee4-Paper.pdf,2019,"game, algorithms, rate, regret, cfr, dilated, distance, optimistic, converge, extensive","regret, decision, optimistic, cfr, dgf, xt, point, player, loss, dilated","{'dilated': 0.356605030025784, 'extensive': 0.3422864087353046, 'form': 0.3422864087353046, 'optimistic': 0.331180023212389, 'generating': 0.3144329993541427, 'distance': 0.3019244822514971, 'minimization': 0.29193662423889444, 'functions': 0.2764994754381021, 'games': 0.27026980798537986, 'regret': 0.25743703970651133}","{'game': 0.319989315525273, 'cfr': 0.3171494232403158, 'dilated': 0.3171494232403158, 'optimistic': 0.2664845304882043, 'regret': 0.22520288257056684, 'rate': 0.201829252003945, 'distance': 0.18136022205136798, 'converge': 0.16186472830206958, 'minimization': 0.1609170558817736, 'games': 0.1599946577626365}"
A Fourier Perspective on Model Robustness in Computer Vision,"Dong Yin, Raphael Gontijo Lopes, Jon Shlens, Ekin Dogus Cubuk, Justin Gilmer","Achieving robustness to distributional shift is a longstanding and challenging goal of computer vision. Data augmentation is a commonly used approach for improving robustness, however robustness gains are typically not uniform across corruption types. Indeed increasing performance in the presence of random noise is often met with reduced performance on other corruptions such as contrast change. Understanding when and why these sorts of trade-offs occur is a crucial step towards mitigating them. Towards this end, we investigate recently observed trade-offs caused by Gaussian data augmentation and adversarial training. We find that both methods improve robustness to corruptions that are concentrated in the high frequency domain while reducing robustness to corruptions that are concentrated in the low frequency domain. This suggests that one way to mitigate these trade-offs via data augmentation is to use a more diverse set of augmentations.
Towards this end we observe that AutoAugment, a recently proposed data augmentation policy optimized for clean accuracy, achieves state-of-the-art robustness on the CIFAR-10-C benchmark.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/b05b57f6add810d3b7490866d74c0053-Paper.pdf,2019,"robustness, augmentation, data, corruptions, offs, towards, trade, concentrated, domain, end","frequency, high, model, data, low, robustness, augmentation, corruptions, models, trained","{'computer': 0.4689725917322821, 'fourier': 0.4689725917322821, 'vision': 0.4413223012338112, 'perspective': 0.3999874718857521, 'robustness': 0.3413269006184798, 'model': 0.2981107379651605}","{'robustness': 0.38262209796291646, 'augmentation': 0.3246321659506358, 'corruptions': 0.30727582934312647, 'offs': 0.29361643210647737, 'trade': 0.22353909546041836, 'towards': 0.20474162226927808, 'concentrated': 0.19201599348046114, 'frequency': 0.18566397967644585, 'data': 0.1300811184019199, 'domain': 0.12490134468195985}"

Deep imitation learning for molecular inverse problems,Eric Jonas,"Many measurement modalities arise from well-understood physical processes and result in information-rich but difficult-to-interpret data. Much of this data still requires laborious human interpretation. This is the case in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, where the observed spectrum of a molecule provides a distinguishing fingerprint of its bond structure. Here we solve the resulting inverse problem: given a molecular formula and a spectrum, can we infer the chemical structure? We show for a wide variety of molecules we can quickly compute the correct molecular structure, and can detect with reasonable certainty when our method cannot. We treat this as a problem of graph-structured prediction, where armed with per-vertex information on a subset of the vertices, we infer the edges and edge types. We frame the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and incrementally construct molecules one bond at a time, training a deep neural network via imitation learning, where we learn to imitate a subisomorphic oracle which knows which remaining bonds are correct. Our method is fast, accurate, and is the first among recent chemical-graph generation approaches to exploit per-vertex information and generate graphs with vertex constraints.

Practical Differentially Private Top-k Selection with Pay-what-you-get Composition,"David Durfee, Ryan M.

Typically, the exponential mechanism or report noisy max are the algorithms used to solve this problem.  However, these algorithms require querying the database for the count of each domain element.  We focus on the setting where the data domain is unknown, which is different than the setting of frequent itemsets where an apriori type algorithm can help prune the space of domain elements to query.  We design algorithms that ensures (approximate) differential privacy and only needs access to the true top-k' elements from the data for any chosen k' ≥ k.  This is a highly desirable feature for making differential privacy practical, since the algorithms require no knowledge of the domain.  We consider both the setting where a user's data can modify an arbitrary number of counts by at most 1, i.e. unrestricted sensitivity, and the setting where a user's data can modify at most some small, fixed number of counts by at most 1, i.e. restricted sensitivity.  Additionally, we provide a pay-what-you-get privacy composition bound for our algorithms.  That is, our algorithms might return fewer than k elements when the top-k elements are queried, but the overall privacy budget only decreases by the size of the outcome set.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/b139e104214a08ae3f2ebcce149cdf6e-Paper.pdf,2019,"algorithms, domain, privacy, data, elements, setting, differential, top, user, counts","privacy, top, composition, algorithms, data, algorithm, dp, domain, indices, mechanism","{'get': 0.40344831778286316, 'top': 0.40344831778286316, 'composition': 0.38183929882604806, 'pay': 0.38183929882604806, 'practical': 0.3295665939794571, 'differentially': 0.31259479400210083, 'selection': 0.31259479400210083, 'private': 0.2807334307822417}","{'privacy': 0.33698382216744244, 'elements': 0.3168386661495367, 'domain': 0.2938101297715195, 'algorithms': 0.2212762603673575, 'user': 0.21296455097988454, 'top': 0.21163082741775266, 'counts': 0.2048275501279743, 'differential': 0.1935160973792379, 'setting': 0.18736313055389023, 'sensitivity': 0.16972215858245432}"
A Communication Efficient Stochastic Multi-Block Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers,Hao Yu,"The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has recently received tremendous interests for distributed large scale optimization in machine learning, statistics, multi-agent networks and related applications. In this paper, we propose a new parallel multi-block stochastic ADMM for distributed stochastic optimization, where each node is only required to perform simple stochastic gradient descent updates. The proposed ADMM is fully parallel, can solve problems with arbitrary block structures, and has a convergence rate comparable to or better than existing state-of-the-art ADMM methods for stochastic optimization. Existing stochastic (or deterministic) ADMMs require each node to exchange its updated primal variables across nodes at each iteration and hence cause significant amount of communication overhead. Existing ADMMs require roughly the same number of inter-node communication rounds as the number of in-node computation rounds. In contrast, the number of communication rounds required by our new ADMM is only the square root of the number of computation rounds.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/b151ce4935a3c2807e1dd9963eda16d8-Paper.pdf,2019,"admm, stochastic, node, number, rounds, communication, existing, optimization, admms, block","communication, xi, algorithm, stochastic, convex, rounds, admm, computation, node, convergence","{'direction': 0.4152962148318234, 'multipliers': 0.4152962148318234, 'alternating': 0.3856866799048685, 'block': 0.35161616939345675, 'communication': 0.32200663446650185, 'method': 0.30533140915317275, 'stochastic': 0.25580601472473635, 'multi': 0.24884196078488902, 'efficient': 0.2416513637148061}","{'admm': 0.4783496611284527, 'rounds': 0.32295728710879484, 'node': 0.2771842008807383, 'stochastic': 0.24423689701683268, 'admms': 0.23423413612886565, 'communication': 0.21593012698405598, 'number': 0.17067416894083257, 'parallel': 0.15044252281774498, 'block': 0.1484455927738965, 'distributed': 0.13225541797202775}"
Distributed estimation of the inverse Hessian by determinantal averaging,"Michal Derezinski, Michael W. Mahoney","In distributed optimization and distributed numerical linear algebra,
we often encounter an inversion bias: if we want to compute a
quantity that depends on the inverse of a sum of distributed matrices,
then the sum of the inverses does not equal the inverse of the sum.An example of this occurs in distributed Newton's method, where we
wish to compute (or implicitly work with) the inverse Hessian
multiplied by the gradient.In this case, locally computed estimates are biased, and so taking a
uniform average will not recover the correct solution.To address this, we propose determinantal averaging, a new
approach for correcting the inversion bias. 
This approach involves reweighting the local estimates of the Newton's
step proportionally to the determinant of the local Hessian estimate,
and then averaging them together to obtain an improved global
estimate. This method provides the first known distributed Newton step that is
asymptotically consistent, i.e., it recovers the exact step in
the limit as the number of distributed partitions grows to infinity.To show this, we develop new expectation identities and moment bounds
for the determinant and adjugate of a random matrix.Determinantal averaging can be applied not only to Newton's method,
but to computing any quantity that is a linear tranformation of a
matrix inverse, e.g., taking a trace of the inverse covariance matrix,
which is used in data uncertainty quantification.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/b1b20d09041289e6c3fbb81850c5da54-Paper.pdf,2019,"distributed, inverse, newton, averaging, matrix, method, step, sum, approach, bias","det, pm, matrix, averaging, newton, determinantal, distributed, corollary, method, hessian","{'hessian': 0.48457177182576555, 'averaging': 0.4500230707057669, 'determinantal': 0.4376921055381057, 'inverse': 0.3757205575935043, 'distributed': 0.3633895924258431, 'estimation': 0.31285319440596454}","{'distributed': 0.34575118358893103, 'newton': 0.3406767534658589, 'inverse': 0.3193106101095874, 'averaging': 0.22207261109483115, 'sum': 0.18115848673008036, 'inversion': 0.1744947853274997, 'determinant': 0.17033837673292945, 'determinantal': 0.16673793183984528, 'quantity': 0.16673793183984528, 'hessian': 0.15364704660659534}"

In this paper, by exploiting the special structures and properties of the graphs formulated in MOT problems, we develop an efficient min-cost flow algorithm, namely, minimum-update Successive Shortest Path (muSSP). muSSP is proved to provide exact optimal solution and we demonstrated its efficiency through 40 experiments on five MOT datasets with various object detection results and a number of graph designs. muSSP is always the most efficient in each experiment compared to the three peer solvers, improving the efficiency by 5 to 337 folds relative to the best competing algorithm and averagely 109 to 4089 folds to each of the three peer methods.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/b1d10e7bafa4421218a51b1e1f1b0ba2-Paper.pdf,2019,"cost, flow, min, mot, problems, efficiency, mussp, algorithm, efficient, folds","graph, path, cost, shortest, ﬂow, nodes, node, tree, mussp, min","{'mussp': 0.4255217186255753, 'tracking': 0.4027304304257682, 'min': 0.3865597541035599, 'cost': 0.3409771777039457, 'flow': 0.33505483856990315, 'object': 0.29609287404788776, 'algorithm': 0.2792239249821233, 'multi': 0.24131264961197307, 'efficient': 0.23433962132606523}","{'mot': 0.42980412655452127, 'mussp': 0.322353094915891, 'min': 0.3117419050703469, 'flow': 0.26570059019029507, 'folds': 0.21490206327726064, 'cost': 0.20075637397512322, 'peer': 0.1888904353564699, 'problems': 0.1606535957526193, 'efficiency': 0.1593220961565003, 'object': 0.11980510806709857}"

models, but training and sample generation require repeated evaluation of Jacobian determinants and function inverses. To make such computations feasible, current approaches employ highly constrained architectures that produce diagonal, triangular, or low rank Jacobian matrices.  As an alternative, we investigate a set of novel normalizing flows based on the circular and symmetric convolutions.  We show that these transforms admit efficient Jacobian determinant computation and inverse mapping (deconvolution) in O(N log N) time. Additionally, element-wise multiplication, widely used in normalizing flow architectures, can be combined with these transforms to increase modeling flexibility.

Thus, methods for controlling the neural level sets could find many applications in machine learning.In this paper we present a simple and scalable approach to directly control level sets of a deep neural network. Our method consists of two parts: (i) sampling of the neural level sets, and (ii) relating the samples' positions to the network parameters. The latter is achieved by a sample network that is constructed by adding a single fixed linear layer to the original network. In turn, the sample network can be used to incorporate the level set samples into a loss function of interest.We have tested our method on three different learning tasks: improving generalization to unseen data, training networks robust to adversarial attacks, and curve and surface reconstruction from point clouds. For surface reconstruction, we produce high fidelity surfaces directly from raw 3D point clouds.

Learning GANs and Ensembles Using Discrepancy,"Ben Adlam, Corinna Cortes, Mehryar Mohri, Ningshan Zhang","Generative adversarial networks (GANs) generate data based on minimizing a divergence between two distributions. The choice of that divergence is therefore critical. We argue that the divergence must take into account the hypothesis set and the loss function used in a subsequent learning task, where the data generated by a GAN serves for training. Taking that structural information into account is also important to derive generalization guarantees. Thus, we propose to use the discrepancy measure, which was originally introduced for the closely related problem of domain adaptation and which precisely takes into account the hypothesis set and the loss function. We show that discrepancy admits favorable properties for training GANs and prove explicit generalization guarantees. We present efficient algorithms using discrepancy for two tasks: training a GAN directly, namely DGAN, and mixing previously trained generative models, namely EDGAN.

Neural Relational Inference with Fast Modular Meta-learning,"Ferran Alet, Erica Weng, Tomás Lozano-Pérez, Leslie Pack Kaelbling","Graph neural networks (GNNs) are effective models for many dynamical systems consisting of entities and relations. Although most GNN applications assume a single type of entity and relation, many situations involve multiple types of interactions. Relational inference is the problem of inferring these interactions and learning the dynamics from observational data. We frame relational inference as a modular meta-learning problem, where neural modules are trained to be composed in different ways to solve many tasks. This meta-learning framework allows us to implicitly encode time invariance and infer relations in context of one another rather than independently, which increases inference capacity.  Framing inference as the inner-loop optimization of meta-learning leads to a model-based approach that is more data-efficient and capable of estimating the state of entities that we do not observe directly, but whose existence can be inferred from their effect on observed entities. To address the large search space of graph neural network compositions, we meta-learn a proposal function that speeds up the inner-loop simulated annealing search within the modular meta-learning algorithm, providing two orders of magnitude increase in the size of problems that can be addressed.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/b294504229c668e750dfcc4ea9617f0a-Paper.pdf,2019,"learning, meta, inference, entities, many, neural, data, graph, inner, interactions","learning, meta, al, et, 2018, modular, neural, modules, graph, data","{'modular': 0.500037772898776, 'relational': 0.500037772898776, 'meta': 0.37908904318883946, 'fast': 0.367935328625568, 'inference': 0.3605375895345895, 'neural': 0.2424611713955818, 'learning': 0.17906638302679814}","{'meta': 0.3704001594120297, 'entities': 0.3036701558848289, 'inference': 0.21564482871342452, 'modular': 0.2024467705898859, 'relational': 0.18917274287184743, 'loop': 0.179754670324187, 'inner': 0.17412867433049975, 'relations': 0.17244944571665752, 'interactions': 0.15917541799861906, 'learning': 0.13603362148385306}"
Identification of Conditional Causal Effects under Markov Equivalence,"Amin Jaber, Jiji Zhang, Elias Bareinboim","Causal identification is the problem of deciding whether a post-interventional distribution is computable from a combination of qualitative knowledge about the data-generating process, which is encoded in a causal diagram, and an observational distribution.

We argue that convolutional kernels in the generator should be aware of the distinct semantic labels at different locations when generating images.

Average Case Column Subset Selection for Entrywise $\ell_1$-Norm Loss,"Zhao Song, David Woodruff, Peilin Zhong","We study the column subset selection problem with respect to the entrywise $\ell_1$-norm loss. It is known that in the worst case, to obtain a good rank-$k$ approximation to a matrix, one needs an arbitrarily large $n^{\Omega(1)}$ number of columns to obtain a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation to an $n \times n$ matrix. Nevertheless, we show that under certain minimal and realistic distributional settings, it is possible to obtain a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation with a nearly linear running time and poly$(k/\epsilon)+O(k\log n)$ columns. Namely, we show that if the input matrix $A$ has the form $A = B + E$, where $B$ is an arbitrary rank-$k$ matrix, and $E$ is a matrix with i.i.d. entries drawn from any distribution $\mu$ for which the $(1+\gamma)$-th moment exists, for an arbitrarily small constant $\gamma > 0$, then it is possible to obtain a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate column subset selection to the entrywise $\ell_1$-norm in nearly linear time. Conversely we show that if the first moment does not exist, then it is not possible to obtain a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate subset selection algorithm even if one chooses any $n^{o(1)}$ columns.

In the case of releasing finite-dimensional summaries using elliptical perturbations, we show that the privacy parameter $\ep$ can be computed in terms of a one-dimensional maximization problem.

Inherent Tradeoffs in Learning Fair Representations,"Han Zhao, Geoff Gordon","With the prevalence of machine learning in high-stakes applications, especially the ones regulated by anti-discrimination laws or societal norms, it is crucial to ensure that the predictive models do not propagate any existing bias or discrimination. Due to the ability of deep neural nets to learn rich representations, recent advances in algorithmic fairness have focused on learning fair representations with adversarial techniques to reduce bias in data while preserving utility simultaneously. In this paper, through the lens of information theory, we provide the first result that quantitatively characterizes the tradeoff between demographic parity and the joint utility across different population groups. Specifically, when the base rates differ between groups, we show that any method aiming to learn fair representations admits an information-theoretic lower bound on the joint error across these groups. To complement our negative results, we also prove that if the optimal decision functions across different groups are close, then learning fair representations leads to an alternative notion of fairness, known as the accuracy parity, which states that the error rates are close between groups.

Don't take it lightly: Phasing optical random projections with unknown operators,"Sidharth Gupta, Remi Gribonval, Laurent Daudet, Ivan Dokmanić","In this paper we tackle the problem of recovering the phase of complex linear measurements when only magnitude information is available and we control the input. We are motivated by the recent development of dedicated optics-based hardware for rapid random projections which leverages the propagation of light in random media. A signal of interest $\mathbf{\xi} \in \mathbb{R}^N$ is mixed by a random scattering medium to compute the projection $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{A} \mathbf{\xi}$, with $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{C}^{M \times N}$ being a realization of a standard complex Gaussian iid random matrix. Such optics-based matrix multiplications can be much faster and energy-efficient than their CPU or GPU counterparts, yet two difficulties must be resolved: only the intensity ${|\mathbf{y}|}^2$ can be recorded by the camera, and the transmission matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is unknown. We show that even without knowing $\mathbf{A}$, we can recover the unknown phase of $\mathbf{y}$ for some equivalent transmission matrix with the same distribution as $\mathbf{A}$. Our method is based on two observations: first, conjugating or changing the phase of any row of $\mathbf{A}$ does not change its distribution; and second, since we control the input we can interfere $\mathbf{\xi}$ with arbitrary reference signals. We show how to leverage these observations to cast the measurement phase retrieval problem as a Euclidean distance geometry problem. We demonstrate appealing properties of the proposed algorithm in both numerical simulations and real hardware experiments. Not only does our algorithm accurately recover the missing phase, but it mitigates the effects of quantization and the sensitivity threshold, thus improving the measured magnitudes.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/b49fdab097253cac48e3dc628a49da5e-Paper.pdf,2019,"mathbf, phase, matrix, random, based, problem, xi, algorithm, complex, control","phase, matrix, mds, random, algorithm, number, anchors, complex, error, figure","{'phasing': 0.39040129084350794, 'take': 0.39040129084350794, 'lightly': 0.36949108122616897, 'optical': 0.36949108122616897, 'operators': 0.34314733263410685, 'projections': 0.34314733263410685, 'unknown': 0.33374484178080227, 'random': 0.2743000962467591}","{'mathbf': 0.7749264468498224, 'phase': 0.23109165171191204, 'xi': 0.18595278262554035, 'optics': 0.1364635036904363, 'matrix': 0.13489339360922534, 'random': 0.12684842214598396, 'transmission': 0.12396852175036024, 'mathbb': 0.09788571124835736, 'hardware': 0.0916694619880755, 'recover': 0.09093358640696672}"
Visualizing the PHATE of Neural Networks,"Scott Gigante, Adam S.

To this end, we introduce a novel visualization algorithm that reveals the internal geometry of such networks: Multislice PHATE (M-PHATE), the first method designed explicitly to visualize how a neural network's hidden representations of data evolve throughout the course of training. We demonstrate that our visualization provides intuitive, detailed summaries of the learning dynamics beyond simple global measures (i.e., validation loss and accuracy), without the need to access validation data. Furthermore, M-PHATE better captures both the dynamics and community structure of the hidden units as compared to visualization based on standard dimensionality reduction methods (e.g., ISOMAP, t-SNE). We demonstrate M-PHATE with two vignettes: continual learning and generalization. In the former, the M-PHATE visualizations display the mechanism of ""catastrophic forgetting"" which is a major challenge for learning in task-switching contexts.

In this work, we propose a global filter pruning algorithm called Gate Decorator, which transforms a vanilla CNN module by multiplying its output by the channel-wise scaling factors (i.e. gate). When the scaling factor is set to zero, it is equivalent to removing the corresponding filter. We use Taylor expansion to estimate the change in the loss function caused by setting the scaling factor to zero and use the estimation for the global filter importance ranking. Then we prune the network by removing those unimportant filters. After pruning, we merge all the scaling factors into its original module, so no special operations or structures are introduced. Moreover, we propose an iterative pruning framework called Tick-Tock to improve pruning accuracy. The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches. For example, we achieve the state-of-the-art pruning ratio on ResNet-56 by reducing 70% FLOPs without noticeable loss in accuracy. For ResNet-50 on ImageNet, our pruned model with 40% FLOPs reduction outperforms the baseline model by 0.31% in top-1 accuracy.

"Kalman Filter, Sensor Fusion, and Constrained Regression: Equivalences and Insights","Maria Jahja, David Farrow, Roni Rosenfeld, Ryan J. Tibshirani","The Kalman filter (KF) is one of the most widely used tools for data assimilation and sequential estimation. In this work, we show that the state estimates from the KF in a standard linear dynamical system setting are equivalent to those given by the KF in a transformed system, with infinite process noise (i.e., a ``flat prior'') and an augmented measurement space. This reformulation---which we refer to as augmented measurement sensor fusion (SF)---is conceptually interesting, because the transformed system here is seemingly static (as there is effectively no process model), but we can still capture the state dynamics inherent to the KF by folding the process model into the measurement space. Further, this reformulation of the KF turns out to be useful in settings in which past states are observed eventually (at some lag). Here, when the measurement noise covariance is estimated by the empirical covariance, we show that the state predictions from SF are equivalent to those from a regression of past states on past measurements, subject to particular linear constraints (reflecting the relationships encoded in the measurement map). This allows us to port standard ideas (say, regularization methods) in regression over to dynamical systems. For example, we can posit multiple candidate process models, fold all of them into the measurement model, transform to the regression perspective, and apply $\ell_1$ penalization to perform process model selection. We give various empirical demonstrations, and focus on an application to nowcasting the weekly incidence of influenza in the US.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/b522259710151f8cc7870b970b4e0930-Paper.pdf,2019,"measurement, kf, process, model, past, regression, state, system, augmented, covariance","xt, sf, sensor, kf, zt, measurement, regression, model, sensors, data","{'equivalences': 0.39317166393724096, 'kalman': 0.39317166393724096, 'insights': 0.372113070891192, 'sensor': 0.372113070891192, 'filter': 0.35717176134504497, 'fusion': 0.35717176134504497, 'constrained': 0.3095824786952127, 'regression': 0.2508209819328927}","{'kf': 0.46709973171467845, 'measurement': 0.3978303871492745, 'process': 0.20152784265238954, 'sf': 0.1768325965714004, 'past': 0.17223946270219065, 'reformulation': 0.16422489450860814, 'system': 0.14970852917306085, 'regression': 0.13933131775336396, 'transformed': 0.13551713557511444, 'dynamical': 0.12550983946064348}"

Quality Aware Generative Adversarial Networks,"KANCHARLA PARIMALA, Sumohana Channappayya","Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have become a very popular tool for im-

Dual Variational Generation for Low Shot Heterogeneous Face Recognition,"Chaoyou Fu, Xiang Wu, Yibo Hu, Huaibo Huang, Ran He","Heterogeneous Face Recognition (HFR) is a challenging issue because of the large domain discrepancy and a lack of heterogeneous data. This paper considers HFR as a dual generation problem, and proposes a novel Dual Variational Generation (DVG) framework. It generates large-scale new paired heterogeneous images with the same identity from noise, for the sake of reducing the domain gap of HFR. Specifically, we first introduce a dual variational autoencoder to represent a joint distribution of paired heterogeneous images. Then, in order to ensure the identity consistency of the generated paired heterogeneous images, we impose a distribution alignment in the latent space and a pairwise identity preserving in the image space. Moreover, the HFR network reduces the domain discrepancy by constraining the pairwise feature distances between the generated paired heterogeneous images. Extensive experiments on four HFR databases show that our method can significantly improve state-of-the-art results. When using the generated paired images for training, our method gains more than 18\% True Positive Rate improvements over the baseline model when False Positive Rate is at $10^{-5}$.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/b5a1fc2085986034e448d2ccc5bb9703-Paper.pdf,2019,"heterogeneous, hfr, images, paired, domain, dual, generated, identity, discrepancy, distribution","images, dvg, heterogeneous, paired, vis, nir, face, identity, image, generated","{'face': 0.4351242946478993, 'heterogeneous': 0.3930284010924624, 'dual': 0.37555702670130553, 'recognition': 0.3562168421871478, 'shot': 0.32977930669053823, 'generation': 0.3230244029304833, 'low': 0.303975497329001, 'variational': 0.2876834131351014}","{'hfr': 0.4724916934690829, 'paired': 0.4153015579312703, 'heterogeneous': 0.39837322273501036, 'images': 0.23285290797241093, 'identity': 0.21965407276849283, 'dual': 0.1874404803551206, 'generated': 0.15612391050434338, 'domain': 0.1477674296407121, 'discrepancy': 0.13029239719377556, 'pairwise': 0.125939501984679}"
Off-Policy Evaluation via Off-Policy Classification,"Alexander Irpan, Kanishka Rao, Konstantinos Bousmalis, Chris Harris, Julian Ibarz, Sergey Levine","In this work, we consider the problem of model selection for deep reinforcement learning (RL) in real-world environments. Typically, the performance of deep RL algorithms is evaluated via on-policy interactions with the target environment. However, comparing models in a real-world environment for the purposes of early stopping or hyperparameter tuning is costly and often practically infeasible.
This leads us to examine off-policy policy evaluation (OPE) in such settings.
We focus on OPE of value-based methods, which are of particular interest in deep RL with applications like robotics, where off-policy algorithms based on Q-function estimation can often attain better sample complexity than direct policy optimization.
Furthermore, existing OPE metrics either rely on a model of the environment, or the use of importance sampling (IS) to correct for the data being off-policy. 
However, for high-dimensional observations, such as images, models of the environment can be difficult to fit and value-based methods can make IS hard to use or even ill-conditioned, especially when dealing with continuous action spaces.
In this paper, we focus on the specific case of MDPs with continuous action spaces and sparse binary rewards, which is representative of many important real-world applications. We propose an alternative metric that relies on neither models nor IS, by framing OPE as a positive-unlabeled (PU) classification problem. We experimentally show that this metric outperforms baselines on a number of tasks. Most importantly, it can reliably predict the relative performance of different policies in a number of generalization scenarios, including the transfer to the real-world of policies trained in simulation for an image-based robotic manipulation task.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/b5b03f06271f8917685d14cea7c6c50a-Paper.pdf,2019,"policy, based, environment, ope, real, world, deep, models, rl, action","policy, real, environment, metrics, st, ope, return, world, learning, softopc","{'policy': 0.7503390106908999, 'evaluation': 0.44268107758709363, 'classification': 0.3859017727472652, 'via': 0.3034874863519898}","{'ope': 0.3966174272739437, 'policy': 0.3156032913268742, 'environment': 0.24339499203058468, 'rl': 0.19575539007934087, 'world': 0.19116029926802772, 'real': 0.159532091067622, 'action': 0.12547587509861646, 'spaces': 0.12547587509861646, 'metric': 0.1243448922137807, 'policies': 0.12325659825926046}"

Scene Representation Networks: Continuous 3D-Structure-Aware Neural Scene Representations,"Vincent Sitzmann, Michael Zollhoefer, Gordon Wetzstein","Unsupervised learning with generative models has the potential of discovering rich representations of 3D scenes. While geometric deep learning has explored 3D-structure-aware representations of scene geometry, these models typically require explicit 3D supervision. Emerging neural scene representations can be trained only with posed 2D images, but existing methods ignore the three-dimensional structure of scenes. We propose Scene Representation Networks (SRNs), a continuous, 3D-structure-aware scene representation that encodes both geometry and appearance. SRNs represent scenes as continuous functions that map world coordinates to a feature representation of local scene properties. By formulating the image formation as a differentiable ray-marching algorithm, SRNs can be trained end-to-end from only 2D images and their camera poses, without access to depth or shape. This formulation naturally generalizes across scenes, learning powerful geometry and appearance priors in the process.

Our technique for removing the batches uses a variant of momentum to achieve variance reduction in non-convex optimization. On smooth losses $F$, STORM finds a point $x$ with $\mathbb{E}[\|\nabla F(x)\|]\le O(1/\sqrt{T}+\sigma^{1/3}/T^{1/3})$ in $T$ iterations with $\sigma^2$ variance in the gradients, matching the best-known rate but without requiring knowledge of $\sigma$.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/b8002139cdde66b87638f7f91d169d96-Paper.pdf,2019,"variance, batches, reduction, sigma, achieve, convex, descent, first, gradient, learning","xt, ϵt, ηt, variance, ξt, g2, momentum, algorithm, storm, sgd","{'momentum': 0.44795664264522106, 'sgd': 0.3988068457361018, 'reduction': 0.39391468759586196, 'variance': 0.37715279234575644, 'convex': 0.3636054154701482, 'non': 0.35491190938597617, 'based': 0.29103878546145306}","{'batches': 0.35237539208361973, 'sigma': 0.3427200455723628, 'variance': 0.3018131870726068, 'storm': 0.26726674880421114, 'reduction': 0.22257558157697543, 'rates': 0.1443608970315603, 'require': 0.13488978532244583, 'mega': 0.13363337440210557, 'nabla': 0.13363337440210557, 'willingness': 0.13363337440210557}"
Adversarial Self-Defense for Cycle-Consistent GANs,"Dina Bashkirova, Ben Usman, Kate Saenko","The goal of unsupervised image-to-image translation is to  map images from one domain to another without the ground truth correspondence between the two domains. State-of-art methods  learn the correspondence using large numbers of unpaired examples from both domains and are based on generative adversarial networks. In order to preserve the semantics of the input image, the adversarial objective is usually combined with a cycle-consistency loss that penalizes incorrect reconstruction of the input image from the translated one. However, if the target mapping is many-to-one, e.g. aerial photos to maps, such a restriction forces the generator to hide information in low-amplitude structured noise that is undetectable by human eye or by the discriminator. In this paper, we show how such self-attacking behavior of unsupervised translation methods affects their performance and provide two defense techniques. We perform a quantitative evaluation of the proposed techniques and show that making the translation model more robust to the self-adversarial attack increases its generation quality and reconstruction reliability and makes the model less sensitive to low-amplitude perturbations.

Ultrametric Fitting by Gradient Descent,"Giovanni Chierchia, Benjamin Perret","We study the problem of fitting an ultrametric distance to a dissimilarity graph in the context of hierarchical cluster analysis. Standard hierarchical clustering methods are specified procedurally, rather than in terms of the cost function to be optimized. We aim to overcome this limitation by presenting a general optimization framework for ultrametric fitting. Our approach consists of modeling the latter as a constrained optimization problem over the continuous space of ultrametrics. So doing, we can leverage the simple, yet effective, idea of replacing the ultrametric constraint with a min-max operation injected directly into the cost function. The proposed reformulation leads to an unconstrained optimization problem that can be efficiently solved by gradient descent methods. The flexibility of our framework allows us to investigate several cost functions, following the classic paradigm of combining a data fidelity term with a regularization. While we provide no theoretical guarantee to find the global optimum, the numerical results obtained  over a number of synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the good performance of our approach with respect to state-of-the-art agglomerative algorithms. This makes us believe that the proposed framework sheds new light on the way to design a new generation of hierarchical clustering methods. Our code is made publicly available

Expressive power of tensor-network factorizations for probabilistic modeling,"Ivan Glasser, Ryan Sweke, Nicola Pancotti, Jens Eisert, Ignacio Cirac","Tensor-network techniques have recently proven useful in machine learning, both as a tool for the formulation of new learning algorithms and for enhancing the mathematical understanding of existing methods. Inspired by these developments, and the natural correspondence between tensor networks and probabilistic graphical models, we provide a rigorous analysis of the expressive power of various tensor-network factorizations of discrete multivariate probability distributions. These factorizations include non-negative tensor-trains/MPS, which are in correspondence with hidden Markov models, and Born machines, which are naturally related to the probabilistic interpretation of quantum circuits. When used to model probability distributions, they exhibit tractable likelihoods and admit efficient learning algorithms. Interestingly, we prove that there exist probability distributions for which there are unbounded separations between the resource requirements of some of these tensor-network factorizations. Of particular interest, using complex instead of real tensors can lead to an arbitrarily large reduction in the number of parameters of the network. Additionally, we introduce locally purified states (LPS), a new factorization inspired by techniques for the simulation of quantum systems, with provably better expressive power than all other representations considered.

PerspectiveNet: 3D Object Detection from a Single RGB Image via Perspective Points,"Siyuan Huang, Yixin Chen, Tao Yuan, Siyuan Qi, Yixin Zhu, Song-Chun Zhu","Detecting 3D objects from a single RGB image is intrinsically ambiguous, thus requiring appropriate prior knowledge and intermediate representations as constraints to reduce the uncertainties and improve the consistencies between the 2D image plane and the 3D world coordinate. To address this challenge, we propose to adopt perspective points as a new intermediate representation for 3D object detection, defined as the 2D projections of local Manhattan 3D keypoints to locate an object; these perspective points satisfy geometric constraints imposed by the perspective projection. We further devise PerspectiveNet, an end-to-end trainable model that simultaneously detects the 2D bounding box, 2D perspective points, and 3D object bounding box for each object from a single RGB image. PerspectiveNet yields three unique advantages: (i) 3D object bounding boxes are estimated based on perspective points, bridging the gap between 2D and 3D bounding boxes without the need of category-specific 3D shape priors. (ii) It predicts the perspective points by a template-based method, and a perspective loss is formulated to maintain the perspective constraints. (iii) It maintains the consistency between the 2D perspective points and 3D bounding boxes via a differentiable projective function. Experiments on SUN RGB-D dataset show that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing RGB-based approaches for 3D object detection.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/b87517992f7dce71b674976b280257d2-Paper.pdf,2019,"3d, perspective, 2d, object, points, bounding, rgb, based, boxes, constraints","3d, perspective, latexit, 2d, points, object, bounding, boxes, box, proposed","{'perspectivenet': 0.39524743261202894, 'rgb': 0.39524743261202894, 'points': 0.328829298021972, 'perspective': 0.3235714347817884, 'single': 0.31877138171829833, '3d': 0.3064614870339345, 'object': 0.29059127257510675, 'detection': 0.28288119186075195, 'image': 0.26131873546321965, 'via': 0.21551189905829352}","{'3d': 0.4426406627746809, 'perspective': 0.4286965304919573, '2d': 0.292172010869769, 'bounding': 0.2899569787514955, 'rgb': 0.2518446372270792, 'object': 0.24635160686249427, 'points': 0.21412553761295255, 'boxes': 0.18438433538417676, 'perspectivenet': 0.13940941650742014, 'constraints': 0.11477932635763945}"
Landmark Ordinal Embedding,"Nikhil Ghosh, Yuxin Chen, Yisong Yue","In this paper, we aim to learn a low-dimensional Euclidean representation from a set of constraints of the form “item j is closer to item i than item k”. Existing approaches for this “ordinal embedding” problem require expensive optimization procedures, which cannot scale to handle increasingly larger datasets. To address this issue, we propose a landmark-based strategy, which we call Landmark Ordinal Embedding (LOE). Our approach trades off statistical efficiency for computational efficiency by exploiting the low-dimensionality of the latent embedding. We derive bounds establishing the statistical consistency of LOE under the popular Bradley- Terry-Luce noise model. Through a rigorous analysis of the computational complexity, we show that LOE is significantly more efficient than conventional ordinal embedding approaches as the number of items grows. We validate these characterizations empirically on both synthetic and real datasets.

Machine Teaching of Active Sequential Learners,"Tomi Peltola, Mustafa Mert Çelikok, Pedram Daee, Samuel Kaski","Machine teaching addresses the problem of finding the best training data that can guide a learning algorithm to a target model with minimal effort. In conventional settings, a teacher provides data that are consistent with the true data distribution. However, for sequential learners which actively choose their queries, such as multi-armed bandits and active learners, the teacher can only provide responses to the learner’s queries, not design the full data. In this setting, consistent teachers can be sub-optimal for finite horizons. We formulate this sequential teaching problem, which current techniques in machine teaching do not address, as a Markov decision process, with the dynamics nesting a model of the learner and the actions being the teacher's responses. Furthermore, we address the complementary problem of learning from a teacher that plans: to recognise the teaching intent of the responses, the learner is endowed with a model of the teacher. We test the formulation with multi-armed bandit learners in simulated experiments and a user study. The results show that learning is improved by (i) planning teaching and (ii) the learner having a model of the teacher.

Beyond Confidence Regions: Tight Bayesian Ambiguity Sets for Robust MDPs,"Marek Petrik, Reazul Hasan Russel","Robust MDPs (RMDPs) can be used to compute policies with provable worst-case guarantees in reinforcement learning.

Spatial-Aware Feature Aggregation for Image based Cross-View Geo-Localization,"Yujiao Shi, Liu Liu, Xin Yu, Hongdong Li","In this paper, we develop a new deep network to explicitly address these inherent differences between ground and aerial views.  We observe there exist some approximate domain correspondences between ground and aerial images. Specifically, pixels lying on the same azimuth direction in an aerial image approximately correspond to a vertical image column in the ground view image. Thus, we propose a two-step approach to exploit this prior knowledge. The first step is to apply a regular polar transform to warp an aerial image such that its domain is closer to that of a ground-view panorama.  Note that polar transform as a pure geometric transformation is agnostic to scene content, hence cannot bring the two domains into full alignment. Then, we add a subsequent spatial-attention mechanism which further brings corresponding deep features closer in the embedding space.  To improve the robustness of feature representation, we introduce a feature aggregation strategy via learning multiple spatial embeddings.

Leveraging Labeled and Unlabeled Data for Consistent Fair Binary Classification,"Evgenii Chzhen, Christophe Denis, Mohamed Hebiri, Luca Oneto, Massimiliano Pontil","We study the problem of fair binary classification using the notion of Equal Opportunity.
It requires the true positive rate to distribute equally across the sensitive groups.
Within this setting we show that the fair optimal classifier is obtained by recalibrating the Bayes classifier by a group-dependent threshold. We provide a constructive expression for the threshold.
This result motivates us to devise a plug-in classification procedure based on both unlabeled and labeled datasets.
While the latter is used to learn the output conditional probability, the former is used for calibration.
The overall procedure can be computed in polynomial time and it is shown to be statistically consistent both in terms of the classification error and fairness measure.

Tight Dimensionality Reduction for Sketching Low Degree Polynomial Kernels,"Michela Meister, Tamas Sarlos, David Woodruff","We revisit the classic randomized sketch of a tensor product of $q$ vectors $x_i\in\mathbb{R}^n$. The $i$-th coordinate $(Sx)_i$ of the sketch is equal to
$\prod_{j = 1}^q \langle u^{i, j}, x^j \rangle / \sqrt{m}$, where $u^{i,j}$ are independent random sign vectors. Kar and Karnick (JMLR, 2012) show that
if the sketching dimension $m = \Omega(\epsilon^{-2} C_{\Omega}^2 \log (1/\delta))$, where $C_{\Omega}$ is a certain property of the point set $\Omega$ one wants to sketch, then with probability $1-\delta$, $\|Sx\|_2 = (1\pm \epsilon)\|x\|_2$ for all $x\in\Omega$. However, in their analysis $C_{\Omega}^2$ can be as large as $\Theta(n^{2q})$, even for a set $\Omega$ of $O(1)$ vectors $x$.

We give a new analysis of this sketch, providing nearly optimal bounds.
Namely, we show an upper bound of
$m = \Theta \left (\epsilon^{-2} \log(n/\delta) + \epsilon^{-1} \log^q(n/\delta) \right ),$
which by composing with CountSketch, can be improved to
$\Theta(\epsilon^{-2}\log(1/(\delta \epsilon)) + \epsilon^{-1} \log^q (1/(\delta \epsilon))$. For the important case of $q = 2$ and $\delta = 1/\poly(n)$, this shows that $m = \Theta(\epsilon^{-2} \log(n) + \epsilon^{-1} \log^2(n))$,
demonstrating that the $\epsilon^{-2}$ and $\log^2(n)$ terms do not multiply each other. We also show a nearly matching lower bound of
$m = \Omega(\eps^{-2} \log(1/(\delta)) + \eps^{-1} \log^q(1/(\delta)))$.
In a number of applications, one has $|\Omega| = \poly(n)$ and in this case our bounds are optimal up to a constant factor. This is the first high probability sketch for tensor products that has optimal sketch size and can be implemented in $m \cdot \sum_{i=1}^q \textrm{nnz}(x_i)$ time, where $\textrm{nnz}(x_i)$ is the
number of non-zero entries of $x_i$.

We establish the consistency, asymptotic normality, and robustness of DKSD and DSM estimators, then derive stochastic Riemannian gradient descent algorithms for their efficient optimisation.

Provably Powerful Graph Networks,"Haggai Maron, Heli Ben-Hamu, Hadar Serviansky, Yaron Lipman","Recently, the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) graph isomorphism test was used to measure the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNN). It was shown that the popular message passing GNN cannot distinguish between graphs that are indistinguishable by the $1$-WL test \citep{morris2019,xu2019}. Unfortunately, many simple instances of graphs are indistinguishable by the $1$-WL test. 

In search for more expressive graph learning models we build upon the recent $k$-order invariant and equivariant graph neural networks \citep{maron2019}  and present two results: 

First, we show that such $k$-order networks can distinguish between non-isomorphic graphs as good as the $k$-WL tests, which are provably stronger than the $1$-WL test for $k>2$. This makes these models strictly stronger than message passing models. Unfortunately, the higher expressiveness of these models comes with a computational cost of processing high order tensors. 

Second, setting our goal at building a provably stronger, \emph{simple} and \emph{scalable}  model we show that a reduced $2$-order network containing just scaled identity operator, augmented with a single quadratic operation (matrix multiplication) has a provable $3$-WL expressive power. Differently put, we suggest a simple model that interleaves applications of standard Multilayer-Perceptron (MLP) applied to the feature dimension and matrix multiplication. 

We validate this model by presenting state of the art results on popular graph classification and regression tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first practical invariant/equivariant model with guaranteed $3$-WL expressiveness, strictly stronger than message passing models.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/bb04af0f7ecaee4aae62035497da1387-Paper.pdf,2019,"wl, graph, models, model, order, stronger, test, expressive, graphs, message","al, et, wl, graph, na, model, networks, order, network, graphs","{'powerful': 0.6687124960844524, 'provably': 0.5563407691551417, 'graph': 0.3906771759472764, 'networks': 0.30113101857867036}","{'wl': 0.5472451365889975, 'stronger': 0.245477187734856, 'passing': 0.18410789080114198, 'graph': 0.18402153256650228, 'message': 0.17775228558227169, 'expressive': 0.16646409551170357, 'test': 0.1575346590438704, 'indistinguishable': 0.14520799666575254, 'citep': 0.14122919009891777, 'order': 0.13997649379998656}"
Regularized Anderson Acceleration for Off-Policy Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Wenjie Shi, Shiji Song, Hui Wu, Ya-Chu Hsu, Cheng Wu, Gao Huang","Model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been widely used for a range of complex control tasks. However, slow convergence and sample inefficiency remain challenging problems in RL, especially when handling continuous and high-dimensional state spaces. To tackle this problem, we propose a general acceleration method for model-free, off-policy deep RL algorithms by drawing the idea underlying regularized Anderson acceleration (RAA), which is an effective approach to accelerating the solving of fixed point problems with perturbations. Specifically, we first explain how policy iteration can be applied directly with Anderson acceleration. Then we extend RAA to the case of deep RL by introducing a regularization term to control the impact of perturbation induced by function approximation errors. We further propose two strategies, i.e., progressive update and adaptive restart, to enhance the performance. The effectiveness of our method is evaluated on a variety of benchmark tasks, including Atari 2600 and MuJoCo.

Input-Cell Attention Reduces Vanishing Saliency of Recurrent Neural Networks,"Aya Abdelsalam Ismail, Mohamed Gunady, Luiz Pessoa, Hector Corrada Bravo, Soheil Feizi","Recent efforts to improve the interpretability of deep neural networks use saliency to characterize the importance of input features to predictions made by models. Work on interpretability using saliency-based methods on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) has mostly targeted language tasks, and their applicability to time series data is less understood. In this work we analyze saliency-based methods for RNNs, both classical and gated cell architectures. We show that RNN saliency vanishes over time, biasing detection of salient features only to later time steps and are, therefore, incapable of reliably detecting important features at arbitrary time intervals. To address this vanishing saliency problem, we propose a novel RNN cell structure (input-cell attention), which can extend any RNN cell architecture. At each time step, instead of only looking at the current input vector, input-cell attention uses a fixed-size matrix embedding, each row of the matrix attending to different inputs from current or previous time steps.  Using synthetic data, we show that the saliency map produced by the input-cell attention RNN is able to faithfully detect important features regardless of their occurrence in time. We also apply the input-cell attention RNN on a neuroscience task analyzing functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data for human subjects performing a variety of tasks. In this case, we use saliency to characterize brain regions (input features) for which activity is important to distinguish between tasks. We show that standard RNN architectures are only capable of detecting important brain regions in the last few time steps of the fMRI data, while the input-cell attention model is able to detect important brain region activity across time without latter time step biases.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/bbc12a3a98d8487f58a87d3a3070516e-Paper.pdf,2019,"time, cell, input, saliency, rnn, attention, features, important, data, brain","time, attention, lstm, input, saliency, cell, features, steps, task, important","{'reduces': 0.4254800253851863, 'cell': 0.4026909703091332, 'saliency': 0.3865218784134433, 'vanishing': 0.37398015637848825, 'input': 0.35506882670156303, 'attention': 0.30198562128959405, 'recurrent': 0.2907069799476197, 'networks': 0.1813376342922534, 'neural': 0.1813376342922534}","{'cell': 0.4386744749148587, 'saliency': 0.40294986640370295, 'rnn': 0.316300740004261, 'input': 0.2595674568719556, 'time': 0.24069929170699256, 'attention': 0.185359270348582, 'important': 0.1750156199257105, 'features': 0.16571716635970676, 'brain': 0.1340290864304576, 'steps': 0.12445023274395552}"

This setting coincides with classic fair division problems, which allows us to apply concepts from that literature in parallel to equalized odds. In particular, we consider the axioms of resource monotonicity, consistency, and population monotonicity, all three of which relate different allocation instances to prevent paradoxes. Using a geometric characterization of equalized odds, we examine the compatibility of equalized odds with these axioms.

Learning Conditional Deformable Templates with Convolutional Networks,"Adrian Dalca, Marianne Rakic, John Guttag, Mert Sabuncu","We develop a learning framework for building deformable templates, which play a fundamental role in many image analysis and computational anatomy tasks. Conventional methods for template creation and image alignment to the template have undergone decades of rich technical development. In these frameworks, templates are constructed using an iterative process of template estimation and alignment, which is often computationally very expensive. Due in part to this shortcoming, most methods compute a single template for the entire population of images, or a few templates for  specific sub-groups of the data. In this work, we present a probabilistic model and efficient learning strategy that yields either universal or \textit{conditional} templates, jointly with a neural network that provides efficient alignment of the images to these templates.

Volumetric Correspondence Networks for Optical Flow,"Gengshan Yang, Deva Ramanan","Many classic tasks in vision -- such as the estimation of optical flow or stereo disparities -- can be cast as dense correspondence matching. Well-known techniques for doing so make use of a cost volume, typically a 4D tensor of match costs between all pixels in a 2D image and their potential matches in a 2D search window. State-of-the-art (SOTA) deep networks for flow/stereo make use of such volumetric representations as internal layers. However, such layers require significant amounts of memory and compute, making them cumbersome to use in practice. As a result, SOTA networks also employ various heuristics designed to limit volumetric processing, leading to limited accuracy and overfitting. Instead, we introduce several simple modifications that dramatically simplify the use of volumetric layers - (1) volumetric encoder-decoder architectures that efficiently capture large receptive fields, (2) multi-channel cost volumes that capture multi-dimensional notions of pixel similarities, and finally, (3) separable volumetric filtering that significantly reduces computation and parameters while preserving accuracy. Our innovations dramatically improve accuracy over SOTA on standard benchmarks while being significantly easier to work with - training converges in 10X fewer iterations, and most importantly, our networks generalize across correspondence tasks. On-the-fly adaptation of search windows allows us to repurpose optical flow networks for stereo (and vice versa), and can also be used to implement adaptive networks that increase search window sizes on-demand.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/bbf94b34eb32268ada57a3be5062fe7d-Paper.pdf,2019,"networks, volumetric, use, accuracy, flow, layers, search, sota, stereo, 2d","cost, 4d, volume, model, 2d, ﬂow, net, pwc, stereo, training","{'volumetric': 0.5275497404840158, 'correspondence': 0.4992937487242053, 'optical': 0.4992937487242053, 'flow': 0.41539147215890765, 'networks': 0.2248392784696735}","{'volumetric': 0.4719141904178295, 'sota': 0.26798285029239516, 'stereo': 0.2572226404731377, 'flow': 0.1750395650014127, 'window': 0.17148176031542514, 'optical': 0.15752750578012034, 'layers': 0.15070555399468877, 'networks': 0.14531642146799925, 'search': 0.14517287820939775, 'dramatically': 0.14408740182485014}"
Variance Reduction in Bipartite Experiments through Correlation Clustering,"Jean Pouget-Abadie, Kevin Aydin, Warren Schudy, Kay Brodersen, Vahab Mirrokni","Causal inference in randomized experiments typically assumes that the units of randomization and the units of analysis are one and the same. In some applications, however, these two roles are played by distinct entities linked by a bipartite graph. The key challenge in such bipartite settings is how to avoid interference bias, which would typically arise if we simply randomized the treatment at the level of analysis units. One effective way of minimizing interference bias in standard experiments is through cluster randomization, but this design has not been studied in the bipartite setting where conventional clustering schemes can lead to poorly powered experiments. This paper introduces a novel clustering objective and a corresponding algorithm that partitions a bipartite graph so as to maximize the statistical power of a bipartite experiment on that graph. Whereas previous work relied on balanced partitioning, our formulation suggests the use of a correlation clustering objective. We use a publicly-available graph of Amazon user-item reviews to validate our solution and illustrate how it substantially increases the statistical power in bipartite experiments.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/bc047286b224b7bfa73d4cb02de1238d-Paper.pdf,2019,"bipartite, experiments, graph, clustering, units, analysis, bias, interference, objective, one","units, treatment, bipartite, outcome, diversion, clustering, graph, unit, al, et","{'experiments': 0.47838234692970727, 'bipartite': 0.4591740490062542, 'correlation': 0.41289317569521883, 'reduction': 0.3709214869328916, 'clustering': 0.35513800054418093, 'variance': 0.35513800054418093}","{'bipartite': 0.5584851258806434, 'units': 0.2356629153864289, 'clustering': 0.21259583288952918, 'interference': 0.20702842902694493, 'graph': 0.20308252780397587, 'randomization': 0.1861617086268811, 'randomized': 0.14954296178566961, 'experiments': 0.14800452734729358, 'power': 0.1335032468776013, 'typically': 0.1250068320379289}"
Attribution-Based Confidence Metric For Deep Neural Networks,"Susmit Jha, Sunny Raj, Steven Fernandes, Sumit K. Jha, Somesh Jha, Brian Jalaian, Gunjan Verma, Ananthram Swami","We propose a novel confidence metric, namely, attribution-based confidence (ABC) for deep neural networks (DNNs).  ABC metric characterizes whether the output of a DNN on an input can be trusted. DNNs are known to be brittle on inputs outside the training distribution and are, hence, susceptible to adversarial attacks. This fragility is compounded by a lack of effectively computable measures of model confidence that correlate well with the accuracy of DNNs. These factors have impeded the adoption of DNNs in high-assurance systems. The proposed ABC metric addresses these challenges. It does not require access to the training data, the use of ensembles, or the need to train a  calibration model on a held-out validation set. Hence, the new metric is usable even when only a trained model is available for inference. We mathematically motivate the proposed metric and evaluate its effectiveness with two sets of experiments.  First, we study the change in accuracy and the associated confidence over out-of-distribution inputs.  Second, we consider several digital and physically realizable attacks such as FGSM, CW, DeepFool, PGD, and adversarial patch generation methods. The ABC metric is low on out-of-distribution data and adversarial examples, where the accuracy of the model is also low. These experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the ABC  metric to make DNNs more trustworthy and resilient.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/bc1ad6e8f86c42a371aff945535baebb-Paper.pdf,2019,"metric, abc, dnns, confidence, model, accuracy, adversarial, distribution, attacks, data","model, attribution, conﬁdence, input, metric, abc, adversarial, data, xj, based","{'attribution': 0.5128398859834289, 'confidence': 0.47661497906895234, 'metric': 0.45941648554264664, 'based': 0.3163447777466055, 'deep': 0.27390438080207286, 'networks': 0.24866873311006849, 'neural': 0.24866873311006849}","{'abc': 0.47651496083028233, 'metric': 0.3800017825810984, 'dnns': 0.363730335042027, 'confidence': 0.24484258034283052, 'adversarial': 0.12572348547112935, 'hence': 0.12079630577357878, 'attacks': 0.12002152097300307, 'accuracy': 0.11724154609217018, 'distribution': 0.1103195071279638, 'inputs': 0.10906085652916817}"
Are Disentangled Representations Helpful for Abstract Visual Reasoning?,"Sjoerd van Steenkiste, Francesco Locatello, Jürgen Schmidhuber, Olivier Bachem","A disentangled representation encodes information about the salient factors of variation in the data independently.

In this paper, we conduct a large-scale study that investigates whether disentangled representations are more suitable for abstract reasoning tasks. Using two new tasks similar to Raven's Progressive Matrices, we evaluate the usefulness of the representations learned by 360 state-of-the-art unsupervised disentanglement models.

Beyond Alternating Updates for Matrix Factorization with Inertial Bregman Proximal Gradient Algorithms,"Mahesh Chandra Mukkamala, Peter Ochs","Matrix Factorization is a popular non-convex optimization problem,  for which alternating minimization schemes are mostly used. They usually suffer from the major drawback that the solution is biased towards one of the optimization variables. A remedy is non-alternating schemes. However, due to a lack of Lipschitz continuity of the gradient in matrix factorization problems, convergence cannot be guaranteed. A recently developed approach relies on the concept of Bregman distances, which generalizes the standard Euclidean distance. We exploit this theory by proposing a novel Bregman distance for matrix factorization problems, which, at the same time, allows for simple/closed form update steps. Therefore,  for non-alternating schemes, such as the recently introduced Bregman Proximal Gradient (BPG) method and an inertial variant Convex--Concave Inertial BPG (CoCaIn BPG), convergence of the whole sequence to a stationary point is proved for Matrix Factorization.

Integrating Bayesian and Discriminative Sparse Kernel Machines for  Multi-class Active Learning,"Weishi Shi, Qi Yu","We propose a novel active learning (AL) model that integrates Bayesian and discriminative kernel machines for fast and accurate multi-class data sampling.

The integration is conducted using the  maximum entropy discrimination framework, resulting in a joint objective function that contains generalized entropy as a regularizer. Such a property allows the proposed AL model to choose data samples that more effectively handle non-separable classification problems. Parameter learning is achieved through a principled optimization framework that leverages  convex duality and sparse structure of KMC to efficiently optimize the joint objective function.

Towards Explaining the Regularization Effect of Initial Large Learning Rate in Training Neural Networks,"Yuanzhi Li, Colin Wei, Tengyu Ma","Stochastic gradient descent with a large initial learning rate is widely used for training modern neural net architectures. Although a small initial learning rate allows for faster training and better test performance initially, the large learning rate achieves better generalization soon after the learning rate is annealed. Towards explaining this phenomenon, we devise a setting in which we can prove that a two layer network trained with large initial learning rate and annealing provably generalizes better than the same network trained with a small learning rate from the start. The key insight in our analysis is that the order of learning different types of patterns is crucial: because the small learning rate model first memorizes low-noise, hard-to-fit patterns, it generalizes worse on hard-to-generalize, easier-to-fit patterns than its large learning rate counterpart. This concept translates to a larger-scale setting: we demonstrate that one can add a small patch to CIFAR-10 images that is immediately memorizable by a model with small initial learning rate, but ignored by the model with large learning rate until after annealing. Our experiments show that this causes the small learning rate model's accuracy on unmodified images to suffer, as it relies too much on the patch early on.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/bce9abf229ffd7e570818476ee5d7dde-Paper.pdf,2019,"learning, rate, small, large, initial, model, better, patterns, annealing, fit","learning, rate, small, large, training, noise, examples, model, patterns, generalize","{'effect': 0.4147778733308747, 'initial': 0.4147778733308747, 'explaining': 0.3925620341945762, 'rate': 0.3122199584191779, 'large': 0.29752150606638095, 'towards': 0.29752150606638095, 'regularization': 0.29142734218389416, 'training': 0.2506387033904142, 'networks': 0.17677642619885833, 'neural': 0.17677642619885833}","{'rate': 0.5247157023967853, 'small': 0.29051202608045695, 'learning': 0.2717429074540828, 'initial': 0.25978189749215264, 'annealing': 0.19523110374195965, 'patterns': 0.1948364231191145, 'large': 0.1859700808928539, 'patch': 0.16529506023069143, 'fit': 0.14493424406637007, 'generalizes': 0.13341183419005875}"
An Algorithm to Learn Polytree Networks with Hidden Nodes,"Firoozeh Sepehr, Donatello Materassi","Ancestral graphs are a prevalent mathematical tool to take into account latent (hidden) variables in a probabilistic graphical model. In ancestral graph representations, the nodes are only the observed (manifest) variables and the notion of m-separation fully characterizes the conditional independence relations among such variables, bypassing the need to explicitly consider latent variables. However, ancestral graph models do not necessarily represent the actual causal structure of the model, and do not contain information about, for example, the precise number and location of the hidden variables. Being able to detect the presence of latent variables while also inferring their precise location within the actual causal structure model is a more challenging task that provides more information about the actual causal relationships among all the model variables, including the latent ones. In this article, we develop an algorithm to exactly recover graphical models of random variables with underlying polytree structures when the latent nodes satisfy specific degree conditions. Therefore, this article proposes an approach for the full identification of hidden variables in a polytree. We also show that the algorithm is complete in the sense that when such degree conditions are not met, there exists another polytree with fewer number of latent nodes satisfying the degree conditions and entailing the same independence relations among the observed variables, making it indistinguishable from the actual polytree.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/bd33f02c4e28615b5af2d24703e066d5-Paper.pdf,2019,"variables, latent, actual, model, polytree, among, ancestral, causal, conditions, degree","hidden, polytree, latent, nodes, yi, quasi, task, skeleton, collapsed, algorithm","{'nodes': 0.48769520530054156, 'polytree': 0.48769520530054156, 'hidden': 0.4615738547533343, 'learn': 0.40698823447064264, 'algorithm': 0.3200216662473194, 'networks': 0.20785345846685221}","{'variables': 0.4838165400003896, 'polytree': 0.34569122700615607, 'ancestral': 0.25926842025461705, 'latent': 0.2585561876332047, 'actual': 0.247965431875295, 'degree': 0.17276566010867606, 'causal': 0.1593387534762372, 'hidden': 0.15582298875358785, 'nodes': 0.1518820212007359, 'article': 0.14119315316406233}"
Provable Gradient Variance Guarantees for Black-Box Variational Inference,Justin Domke,Recent variational inference methods use stochastic gradient estimators whose variance is not well understood.

LiteEval: A Coarse-to-Fine Framework for Resource Efficient Video Recognition,"Zuxuan Wu, Caiming Xiong, Yu-Gang Jiang, Larry S. Davis","This paper presents LiteEval, a simple yet effective coarse-to-fine framework for resource efficient video recognition, suitable for both online and offline scenarios. Exploiting decent yet computationally efficient features derived at a coarse scale with a lightweight CNN model, LiteEval dynamically decides on-the-fly whether to compute more powerful features for incoming video frames at a finer scale to obtain more details. This is achieved by a coarse LSTM and a fine LSTM operating cooperatively, as well as a conditional gating module to learn when to allocate more computation. Extensive experiments are conducted on two large-scale video benchmarks, FCVID and ActivityNet, and the results demonstrate LiteEval requires substantially less computation while offering excellent classification accuracy for both online and offline predictions.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/bd853b475d59821e100d3d24303d7747-Paper.pdf,2019,"coarse, liteeval, scale, video, computation, efficient, features, fine, lstm, offline","ﬁne, features, video, liteeval, lstm, coarse, frames, computation, gating, fcvid","{'liteeval': 0.4307751680720651, 'coarse': 0.4077025008611824, 'fine': 0.37863437789756565, 'resource': 0.3682595157425839, 'video': 0.3451868485317012, 'recognition': 0.3337678433379436, 'framework': 0.2870506026044677, 'efficient': 0.23723275533088747}","{'liteeval': 0.41014439252400503, 'coarse': 0.3047170606675707, 'video': 0.2582613236502982, 'lstm': 0.2233576305828241, 'offline': 0.21529784452420353, 'scale': 0.17881674865790914, 'fine': 0.16433400052052052, 'yet': 0.14998374271810447, 'computation': 0.14501295661991398, 'online': 0.13974120530452783}"
Multi-marginal Wasserstein GAN,"Jiezhang Cao, Langyuan Mo, Yifan Zhang, Kui Jia, Chunhua Shen, Mingkui Tan","Multiple marginal matching problem aims at learning mappings to match a source domain to multiple target domains and it has attracted great attention in many applications, such as multi-domain image translation. However, addressing this problem has two critical challenges: (i) Measuring the multi-marginal distance among different domains is very intractable; (ii) It is very difficult to exploit cross-domain correlations to match the target domain distributions. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-marginal Wasserstein GAN (MWGAN) to minimize Wasserstein distance among domains.

Learning to Infer Implicit Surfaces without 3D Supervision,"Shichen Liu, Shunsuke Saito, Weikai Chen, Hao Li","Recent advances in 3D deep learning have shown that it is possible to train highly effective deep models for 3D shape generation, directly from 2D images. This is particularly interesting since the availability of 3D models is still limited compared to the massive amount of accessible 2D images, which is invaluable for training. The representation of 3D surfaces itself is a key factor for the quality and resolution of the 3D output. While explicit representations, such as point clouds and voxels, can span a wide range of shape variations, their resolutions are often limited. Mesh-based representations are more efficient but are limited by their ability to handle varying topologies. Implicit surfaces, however, can robustly handle complex shapes, topologies, and also provide flexible resolution control. We address the fundamental problem of learning implicit surfaces for shape inference without the need of 3D supervision. Despite their advantages, it remains nontrivial to (1) formulate a differentiable connection between implicit surfaces and their 2D renderings, which is needed for image-based supervision; and (2) ensure precise geometric properties and control, such as local smoothness. In particular, sampling implicit surfaces densely is also known to be a computationally demanding and very slow operation. To this end, we propose a novel ray-based field probing technique for efficient image-to-field supervision, as well as a general geometric regularizer for implicit surfaces, which provides natural shape priors in unconstrained regions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on the task of single-view image-based 3D shape digitization and show how we outperform state-of-the-art techniques both quantitatively and qualitatively.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/bdf3fd65c81469f9b74cedd497f2f9ce-Paper.pdf,2019,"3d, surfaces, implicit, shape, based, 2d, image, limited, supervision, also","3d, implicit, surface, sampling, ﬁeld, point, based, ray, 2d, learning","{'infer': 0.46544550378066896, 'surfaces': 0.46544550378066896, 'supervision': 0.4091082351797265, 'without': 0.38021050678071067, '3d': 0.3415610981827194, 'implicit': 0.3415610981827194, 'learning': 0.1465039961189893}","{'surfaces': 0.4524667559832462, '3d': 0.37111803231805945, 'shape': 0.2939069899786539, 'implicit': 0.26799808554887417, '2d': 0.17497311491045414, 'supervision': 0.17115572220209901, 'topologies': 0.16027176104850185, 'limited': 0.12788206671012659, 'resolution': 0.11950603414650318, 'image': 0.1089234749820382}"
On Sample Complexity Upper and Lower Bounds for Exact Ranking from Noisy Comparisons,"Wenbo Ren, Jia (Kevin) Liu, Ness Shroff","This paper studies the problem of finding the exact ranking from noisy comparisons. A noisy comparison over a set of $m$ items produces a noisy outcome about the most preferred item, and reveals some information about the ranking. By repeatedly and adaptively choosing items to compare, we want to fully rank the items with a certain confidence, and use as few comparisons as possible. Different from most previous works, in this paper, we have three main novelties: (i) compared to prior works, our upper bounds (algorithms) and lower bounds on the sample complexity (aka number of comparisons) require the minimal assumptions on the instances, and are not restricted to specific models; (ii) we give lower bounds and upper bounds on instances with \textit{unequal} noise levels; and (iii) this paper aims at the \textit{exact} ranking without knowledge on the instances, while most of the previous works either focus on approximate rankings or study exact ranking but require prior knowledge. We first derive lower bounds for pairwise ranking (i.e., compare two items each time), and then propose (nearly) \textit{optimal} pairwise ranking algorithms. We further make extensions to listwise ranking (i.e., comparing multiple items each time).

Are Labels Required for Improving Adversarial Robustness?,"Jean-Baptiste Alayrac, Jonathan Uesato, Po-Sen Huang, Alhussein Fawzi, Robert Stanforth, Pushmeet Kohli","Recent work has uncovered the interesting (and somewhat surprising) finding that training models to be invariant to adversarial perturbations requires substantially larger datasets than those required for standard classification. This result is a key hurdle in the deployment of robust machine learning models in many real world applications where labeled data is expensive. Our main insight is that unlabeled data can be a competitive alternative to labeled data for training adversarially robust models. Theoretically, we show that in a simple statistical setting, the sample complexity for learning an adversarially robust model from unlabeled data matches the fully supervised case up to constant factors. On standard datasets like CIFAR- 10, a simple Unsupervised Adversarial Training (UAT) approach using unlabeled data improves robust accuracy by 21.7% over using 4K supervised examples alone, and captures over 95% of the improvement from the same number of labeled examples. Finally, we report an improvement of 4% over the previous state-of-the- art on CIFAR-10 against the strongest known attack by using additional unlabeled data from the uncurated 80 Million Tiny Images dataset. This demonstrates that our finding extends as well to the more realistic case where unlabeled data is also uncurated, therefore opening a new avenue for improving adversarial training.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/bea6cfd50b4f5e3c735a972cf0eb8450-Paper.pdf,2019,"data, unlabeled, robust, training, adversarial, labeled, models, using, 10, adversarially","data, uat, adversarial, 10, unlabeled, cifar, training, supervised, unsupervised, examples","{'labels': 0.5303898927290496, 'required': 0.5303898927290496, 'improving': 0.44906179181506994, 'robustness': 0.370527532945618, 'adversarial': 0.31372914726369816}","{'unlabeled': 0.3776252581116202, 'uncurated': 0.23988242591001258, 'labeled': 0.2280377841084271, 'data': 0.2278856192242982, 'robust': 0.22081365262939925, 'adversarially': 0.17025721327178497, 'adversarial': 0.1582261689964979, 'training': 0.1529890042705596, 'finding': 0.140525512756117, 'improvement': 0.13725583133033356}"
NAT: Neural Architecture Transformer for Accurate and Compact Architectures,"Yong Guo, Yin Zheng, Mingkui Tan, Qi Chen, Jian Chen, Peilin Zhao, Junzhou Huang","Designing effective architectures is one of the key factors behind the success of deep neural networks. Existing deep architectures are either manually designed or automatically searched by some Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods. However, even a well-searched architecture may still contain many non-significant or redundant modules or operations (e.g., convolution or pooling), which may not only incur substantial memory consumption and computation cost but also deteriorate the performance. Thus, it is necessary to optimize the operations inside an architecture to improve the performance without introducing extra computation cost. Unfortunately, such a constrained optimization problem is NP-hard. To make the problem feasible, we cast the optimization problem into a Markov decision process (MDP) and seek to learn a Neural Architecture Transformer (NAT) to replace the redundant operations with the more computationally efficient ones (e.g., skip connection or directly removing the connection). Based on MDP, we learn NAT by exploiting reinforcement learning to obtain the optimization policies w.r.t. different architectures. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategies, we apply NAT on both hand-crafted architectures and NAS based architectures. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, i.e., CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, demonstrate that the transformed architecture by NAT significantly outperforms both its original form and those architectures optimized by existing methods.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/beed13602b9b0e6ecb5b568ff5058f07-Paper.pdf,2019,"architectures, architecture, nat, neural, operations, optimization, problem, based, computation, connection","architecture, architectures, nat, neural, optimization, based, nao, parameters, model, method","{'nat': 0.4630823366930011, 'architectures': 0.4206812164134491, 'compact': 0.4206812164134491, 'transformer': 0.3864484632549963, 'accurate': 0.3534770307817918, 'architecture': 0.3440473429754443, 'neural': 0.1973635668147191}","{'nat': 0.43638817891452114, 'architectures': 0.33779961318123153, 'architecture': 0.2665377918210578, 'operations': 0.2163974811823503, 'searched': 0.20650743714635775, 'nas': 0.174842320751868, 'redundant': 0.174842320751868, 'mdp': 0.1548638566682811, 'connection': 0.13113689324063596, 'optimization': 0.11906457642221063}"

Modeling Dynamic Functional Connectivity with Latent Factor Gaussian Processes,"Lingge Li, Dustin Pluta, Babak Shahbaba, Norbert Fortin, Hernando Ombao, Pierre Baldi","Dynamic functional connectivity, as measured by the time-varying covariance of neurological signals, is believed to play an important role in many aspects of cognition. While many methods have been proposed, reliably establishing the presence and characteristics of brain connectivity is challenging due to the high dimensionality and noisiness of neuroimaging data.

ETNet: Error Transition Network for Arbitrary Style Transfer,"Chunjin Song, Zhijie Wu, Yang Zhou, Minglun Gong, Hui Huang","Numerous valuable efforts have been devoted to achieving arbitrary style transfer since the seminal work of Gatys et al. However, existing state-of-the-art approaches often generate insufficiently stylized results under challenging cases. We believe a fundamental reason is that these approaches try to generate the stylized result in a single shot and hence fail to fully satisfy the constraints on semantic structures in the content images and style patterns in the style images. Inspired by the works on error-correction, instead, we propose a self-correcting model to predict what is wrong with the current stylization and refine it accordingly in an iterative manner. For each refinement, we transit the error features across both the spatial and scale domain and invert the processed features into a residual image, with a network we call Error Transition Network (ETNet). The proposed model improves over the state-of-the-art methods with better semantic structures and more adaptive style pattern details. Various qualitative and quantitative experiments show that the key concept of both progressive strategy and error-correction leads to better results.

Icebreaker: Element-wise Efficient Information Acquisition with a Bayesian Deep Latent Gaussian Model,"Wenbo Gong, Sebastian Tschiatschek, Sebastian Nowozin, Richard E. Turner, José Miguel Hernández-Lobato, Cheng Zhang","In this paper, we address the ice-start problem, i.e., the challenge of deploying machine learning models when only a little or no training data is initially available, and acquiring each feature element of data is associated with costs. This setting is representative of the real-world machine learning applications. For instance, in the health care domain, obtaining every single measurement comes with a cost. We propose Icebreaker, a principled framework for elementwise training data acquisition. Icebreaker introduces a full Bayesian Deep Latent Gaussian Model (BELGAM) with a novel inference method, which combines recent advances in amortized inference and stochastic gradient MCMC to enable fast and accurate posterior inference. By utilizing BELGAM’s ability to fully quantify model uncertainty, we also propose two information acquisition functions for imputation and active prediction problems. We demonstrate that BELGAM performs significantly better than previous variational autoencoder (VAE) based models, when the data set size is small, using both machine learning benchmarks and real world recommender systems and health-care applications. Moreover, Icebreaker not only demonstrates improved performance compared to baselines, but it is also capable of achieving better test performance with less training data available.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/c055dcc749c2632fd4dd806301f05ba6-Paper.pdf,2019,"data, belgam, icebreaker, inference, learning, machine, training, acquisition, also, applications","data, training, xo, xi, icebreaker, feature, model, set, active, features","{'element': 0.39626863202484747, 'icebreaker': 0.39626863202484747, 'acquisition': 0.3750441628574615, 'wise': 0.3483044940555786, 'gaussian': 0.28125275430090135, 'information': 0.27842255252060155, 'latent': 0.2757375546664044, 'bayesian': 0.2381615259227, 'model': 0.2288309472465806, 'efficient': 0.21822961580443137}","{'belgam': 0.3699319801386894, 'icebreaker': 0.3699319801386894, 'care': 0.23341208226413152, 'health': 0.2108307410464579, 'acquisition': 0.18564176937935725, 'data': 0.167348209470236, 'inference': 0.1609442075211532, 'machine': 0.1448912047050056, 'ice': 0.12331066004622979, 'training': 0.11796513453320934}"

Post training 4-bit quantization of convolutional networks for rapid-deployment,"Ron Banner, Yury Nahshan, Daniel Soudry","Convolutional neural networks require significant memory bandwidth and storage for intermediate computations, apart from substantial computing resources. Neural network quantization has significant benefits in reducing the amount of intermediate results, but it often requires the full datasets and time-consuming fine tuning to recover the accuracy lost after quantization. This paper introduces the first practical 4-bit post training quantization approach: it does not involve training the quantized model (fine-tuning), nor it requires the availability of the full dataset. We target the quantization of both activations and weights and suggest three complementary methods for minimizing quantization error at the tensor level, two of whom obtain a closed-form analytical solution.

Implicit Regularization in Deep Matrix Factorization,"Sanjeev Arora, Nadav Cohen, Wei Hu, Yuping Luo","Efforts to understand the generalization mystery in deep learning have led to the belief that gradient-based optimization induces a form of implicit regularization, a bias towards models of low ""complexity.""

Our first finding, supported by theory and experiments, is that adding depth to a matrix factorization enhances an implicit tendency towards low-rank solutions, oftentimes leading to more accurate recovery.  Secondly, we present theoretical and empirical arguments questioning a nascent view by which implicit regularization in matrix factorization can be captured using simple mathematical norms.

The classic Dawid-Skene estimator and its accompanying expectation maximization (EM) algorithm have been widely used, but the theoretical properties are not fully understood. Tensor methods were proposed to guarantee identification of the Dawid-Skene model, but the sample complexity is a hurdle for applying such approaches---since the tensor methods hinge on the availability of third-order statistics that are hard to reliably estimate given limited data. In this paper, we propose a framework using pairwise co-occurrences of the annotator responses, which naturally admits lower sample complexity. We show that the approach can identify the Dawid-Skene model under realistic conditions.

For example, they may be able to strategically adjust their behavior in earlier rounds to achieve lower, more favorable future prices. Such non-truthful behavior can hinder learning and harm revenue.  In this paper, we combine tools from differential privacy, mechanism design, and sample complexity to give a repeated auction that (1) learns bidder demand from past data, (2) is approximately revenue-optimal, and (3) strategically robust, as it incentivizes bidders to behave truthfully.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/c14a2a57ead18f3532a5a8949382c536-Paper.pdf,2019,"learning, revenue, bidders, rounds, behavior, demand, distribution, earlier, maximizing, optimal","round, mechanism, revenue, bidders, rounds, algorithm, bid, private, approximate, differentially","{'incentive': 0.5792660423850419, 'auctions': 0.5232252237949149, 'guarantees': 0.46718440520478777, 'robust': 0.3678470383821368, 'learning': 0.1926486574343864}","{'revenue': 0.399709576412037, 'bidders': 0.3669868832682472, 'rounds': 0.25299704428994896, 'strategically': 0.23155384553439065, 'earlier': 0.1998547882060185, 'demand': 0.19604820190354333, 'maximizing': 0.1686646961932993, 'behavior': 0.1336761616678921, 'bidder': 0.12232896108941574, 'hinder': 0.12232896108941574}"
Local SGD with  Periodic Averaging: Tighter Analysis  and Adaptive Synchronization,"Farzin Haddadpour, Mohammad Mahdi Kamani, Mehrdad Mahdavi, Viveck Cadambe","Communication overhead is one of the key challenges that hinders the scalability of distributed optimization algorithms. In this paper, we study local distributed SGD, where data is partitioned among computation nodes, and the computation nodes perform local updates with periodically exchanging the model among the workers to perform averaging. While local SGD is empirically shown to provide promising results, a theoretical understanding of its performance remains open. In this paper, we strengthen convergence analysis for local SGD, and show that local SGD can be far less expensive and applied far more generally than current theory suggests. Specifically, we show that for loss functions that satisfy the Polyak-Kojasiewicz condition, $O((pT)^{1/3})$ rounds of communication suffice to achieve a linear speed up, that is, an error of $O(1/pT)$, where $T$ is the total number of model updates at each worker. This is in contrast with previous work which required higher number of communication rounds, as well as was limited to strongly convex loss functions, for a similar asymptotic performance. We also develop an adaptive synchronization scheme that provides a general condition for linear speed up. Finally, we validate the theory with experimental results, running over AWS EC2 clouds and an internal GPUs cluster.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/c17028c9b6e0c5deaad29665d582284a-Paper.pdf,2019,"local, sgd, communication, among, computation, condition, distributed, far, functions, linear","sgd, local, number, communication, updates, averaging, τi, lupa, convergence, linear","{'periodic': 0.42180557076823694, 'synchronization': 0.42180557076823694, 'tighter': 0.42180557076823694, 'averaging': 0.3707504557338849, 'sgd': 0.3133807411256547, 'local': 0.3059404600292848, 'analysis': 0.2656041799310923, 'adaptive': 0.25774337351617616}","{'sgd': 0.30245101878254405, 'local': 0.29193942680937435, 'pt': 0.247485556789686, 'communication': 0.22814602767769304, 'rounds': 0.1706140388850795, 'updates': 0.16120909277282489, 'condition': 0.15391404981960427, 'far': 0.1520973517851287, 'speed': 0.15037631483500288, 'nodes': 0.14497950250282224}"
Scalable Bayesian inference of dendritic voltage via spatiotemporal recurrent state space models,"Ruoxi Sun, Scott Linderman, Ian Kinsella, Liam Paninski","Recent advances in optical voltage sensors have brought us closer to a critical goal in cellular neuroscience: imaging the full spatiotemporal voltage on a dendritic tree.  However, current sensors and imaging approaches still face significant limitations in SNR and sampling frequency; therefore statistical denoising and interpolation methods remain critical for understanding single-trial spatiotemporal dendritic voltage dynamics.  Previous denoising approaches were either based on an inadequate linear voltage model or scaled poorly to large trees.  Here we introduce a scalable fully Bayesian approach.  We develop a generative nonlinear model that requires few parameters per compartment of the cell but is nonetheless flexible enough to sample realistic spatiotemporal data.  The model captures different dynamics in each compartment and leverages biophysical knowledge to constrain intra- and inter-compartmental dynamics.  We obtain a full posterior distribution over spatiotemporal voltage via an augmented Gibbs sampling algorithm.

Constrained Reinforcement Learning Has Zero Duality Gap,"Santiago Paternain, Luiz Chamon, Miguel Calvo-Fullana, Alejandro Ribeiro","Autonomous agents must often deal with conflicting requirements, such as completing tasks using the least amount of time/energy, learning multiple tasks, or dealing with multiple opponents. In the context of reinforcement learning~(RL), these problems are addressed by (i)~designing a reward function that simultaneously describes all requirements or (ii)~combining modular value functions that encode them individually. Though effective, these methods have critical downsides. Designing good reward functions that balance different objectives is challenging, especially as the number of objectives grows. Moreover, implicit interference between goals may lead to performance plateaus as they compete for resources, particularly when training on-policy. Similarly, selecting parameters to combine value functions is at least as hard as designing an all-encompassing reward, given that the effect of their values on the overall policy is not straightforward. The later is generally addressed by formulating the conflicting requirements as a constrained RL problem and solved using Primal-Dual methods. These algorithms are in general not guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution since the problem is not convex. This work provides theoretical support to these approaches by establishing that despite its non-convexity, this problem has zero duality gap, i.e., it can be solved exactly in the dual domain, where it becomes convex. Finally, we show this result basically holds if the policy is described by a good parametrization~(e.g., neural networks) and we connect this result with primal-dual algorithms present in the literature and we establish the convergence to the optimal solution.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/c1aeb6517a1c7f33514f7ff69047e74e-Paper.pdf,2019,"designing, dual, functions, policy, problem, requirements, reward, addressed, algorithms, conflicting","problem, pi, dual, policy, duality, st, function, gap, parametrization, since","{'duality': 0.548294430896035, 'gap': 0.4819291735782916, 'constrained': 0.4317257944577365, 'zero': 0.4023587002627243, 'reinforcement': 0.29841815990744114, 'learning': 0.17258159016164573}","{'requirements': 0.24954423139370457, 'conflicting': 0.22392175212991644, 'dual': 0.22207798232932424, 'designing': 0.21286519833903048, 'reward': 0.19676338678792246, 'addressed': 0.1914254165871484, 'primal': 0.16432205047260243, 'policy': 0.16186796964763694, 'solved': 0.15041960663520035, 'objectives': 0.14284924092170723}"

Stabilizing Off-Policy Q-Learning via Bootstrapping Error Reduction,"Aviral Kumar, Justin Fu, Matthew Soh, George Tucker, Sergey Levine","Off-policy reinforcement learning aims to leverage experience collected from prior policies for sample-efficient learning. However, in practice, commonly used off-policy approximate dynamic programming methods based on Q-learning and actor-critic methods are highly sensitive to the data distribution, and can make only limited progress without collecting additional on-policy data. As a step towards more robust off-policy algorithms, we study the setting where the off-policy experience is fixed and there is no further interaction with the environment. We identify \emph{bootstrapping error} as a key source of instability in current methods. Bootstrapping error is due to bootstrapping from actions that lie outside of the training data distribution, and it accumulates via the Bellman backup operator. We theoretically analyze bootstrapping error, and demonstrate how carefully constraining action selection in the backup can mitigate it. Based on our analysis, we propose a practical algorithm, bootstrapping error accumulation reduction (BEAR).

Fine-grained Optimization of Deep Neural Networks,Mete Ozay,"In recent studies, several asymptotic upper bounds on generalization errors on deep neural networks (DNNs) are theoretically derived. These bounds are functions of several norms of weights of the DNNs, such as the Frobenius and spectral norms, and they are computed for weights grouped according to either input and output channels of the DNNs. In this work, we conjecture that if we can impose multiple constraints on weights of DNNs to upper bound the norms of the weights, and train the DNNs with these weights, then we can attain empirical generalization errors closer to the derived theoretical bounds, and improve accuracy of the DNNs.To this end, we pose two problems. First, we aim to obtain weights whose different norms are all upper bounded by a constant number. To achieve these bounds, we propose a two-stage renormalization procedure; (i) normalization of weights according to different norms used in the bounds, and (ii) reparameterization of the normalized weights to set a constant and finite upper bound of their norms. In the second problem, we consider training DNNs with these renormalized weights.

Learning to Control Self-Assembling Morphologies: A Study of Generalization via Modularity,"Deepak Pathak, Christopher Lu, Trevor Darrell, Phillip Isola, Alexei A. Efros","Contemporary sensorimotor learning approaches typically start with an existing complex agent (e.g., a robotic arm), which they learn to control. In contrast, this paper investigates a modular co-evolution strategy: a collection of primitive agents learns to dynamically self-assemble into composite bodies while also learning to coordinate their behavior to control these bodies. Each primitive agent consists of a limb with a motor attached at one end. Limbs may choose to link up to form collectives. When a limb initiates a link-up action and there is another limb nearby, the latter is magnetically connected to the 'parent' limb's motor. This forms a new single agent, which may further link with other agents. In this way, complex morphologies can emerge, controlled by a policy whose architecture is in explicit correspondence with the morphology. We evaluate the performance of these dynamic and modular agents in simulated environments. We demonstrate better generalization to test-time changes both in the environment, as well as in the structure of the agent, compared to static and monolithic baselines.

An adaptive Mirror-Prox method for variational inequalities with singular operators,"Kimon Antonakopoulos, Veronica Belmega, Panayotis Mertikopoulos","Lipschitz continuity is a central requirement for achieving the optimal O(1/T) rate of convergence in monotone, deterministic variational inequalities (a setting that includes convex minimization, convex-concave optimization, nonatomic games, and many other problems). However, in many cases of practical interest, the operator defining the variational inequality may become singular at the boundary of the feasible region, precluding in this way the use of fast gradient methods that attain this rate (such as Nemirovski's mirror-prox algorithm and its variants). To address this issue, we propose a novel smoothness condition which we call Bregman smoothness, and which relates the variation of the operator to that of a suitably chosen Bregman function. Leveraging this condition, we derive an adaptive mirror prox algorithm which attains an O(1/T) rate of convergence in problems with possibly singular operators, without any prior knowledge of the problem's Bregman constant (the Bregman analogue of the Lipschitz constant).

Fisher Efficient Inference of Intractable Models,"Song Liu, Takafumi Kanamori, Wittawat Jitkrittum, Yu Chen","Maximum Likelihood Estimators (MLE) has many good properties. For example, the asymptotic variance of MLE solution attains equality of the asymptotic Cram{\'e}r-Rao lower bound (efficiency bound), which is the minimum possible variance for an unbiased estimator. However, obtaining such MLE solution requires calculating the likelihood function which may not be tractable due to the normalization term of the density model. In this paper, we derive a Discriminative Likelihood Estimator (DLE) from the Kullback-Leibler divergence minimization criterion implemented via density ratio estimation and a Stein operator. We study the problem of model inference using DLE. We prove its consistency and show that the asymptotic variance of its solution can attain the equality of the efficiency bound under mild regularity conditions. We also propose a dual formulation of DLE which can be easily optimized.

Online Learning via the Differential Privacy Lens,"Jacob D. Abernethy, Young Hun Jung, Chansoo Lee, Audra McMillan, Ambuj Tewari","In this paper, we use differential privacy as a lens to examine online learning in both full and partial information settings. The differential privacy framework is, at heart, less about privacy and more about algorithmic stability, and thus has found application in domains well beyond those where information security is central. Here we develop an algorithmic property called one-step differential stability which facilitates a more refined regret analysis for online learning methods. We show that tools from the differential privacy literature can yield regret bounds for many interesting online learning problems including online convex optimization and online linear optimization. Our stability notion is particularly well-suited for deriving first-order regret bounds for follow-the-perturbed-leader algorithms, something that all previous analyses have struggled to achieve. We also generalize the standard max-divergence to obtain a broader class called Tsallis max-divergences.

Characterization and Learning of Causal Graphs with Latent Variables from Soft Interventions,"Murat Kocaoglu, Amin Jaber, Karthikeyan Shanmugam, Elias Bareinboim","The challenge of learning the causal structure underlying a certain phenomenon is undertaken by connecting the set of conditional independences (CIs) readable from the observational data, on the one side, with the set of  corresponding constraints implied over the graphical structure, on the other, which are tied through a graphical criterion known as d-separation (Pearl, 1988). In this paper, we investigate the more general scenario where multiple observational and experimental distributions are available. We start with the simple observation that the invariances given by CIs/d-separation are just one special type of a broader set of constraints, which follow from the careful comparison of the different distributions available. Remarkably, these new constraints are intrinsically connected with do-calculus (Pearl, 1995) in the context of soft-interventions. We introduce a novel notion of interventional equivalence class of causal graphs with latent variables based on these invariances, which associates each graphical structure with a set of interventional distributions that respect the do-calculus rules. Given a collection of distributions, two causal graphs are called interventionally equivalent if they are associated with the same family of interventional distributions, where the elements of the family are indistinguishable using the invariances obtained from a direct application of the calculus rules. We introduce a graphical representation that can be used to determine if two causal graphs are interventionally equivalent. We provide a formal graphical characterization of this equivalence. Finally, we extend the FCI algorithm, which was originally designed to operate based on CIs, to combine observational and interventional datasets, including new orientation rules particular to this setting.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/c3d96fbd5b1b45096ff04c04038fff5d-Paper.pdf,2019,"distributions, graphical, causal, interventional, set, calculus, cis, constraints, graphs, invariances","causal, graph, set, augmented, px, markov, two, graphs, rule, constraints","{'interventions': 0.434643685736922, 'characterization': 0.41719160904603764, 'soft': 0.4036547266903788, 'variables': 0.37514221177179474, 'causal': 0.32594757060507773, 'graphs': 0.32266761198954735, 'latent': 0.319555932141893, 'learning': 0.144551063574849}","{'interventional': 0.3037154291475704, 'graphical': 0.30342393340003737, 'cis': 0.2664555689212196, 'invariances': 0.25218399264694086, 'calculus': 0.24205814813495655, 'causal': 0.21834101850642526, 'distributions': 0.2064011474106925, 'observational': 0.1820543600400224, 'interventionally': 0.17763704594747973, 'rules': 0.17233078319768638}"
Domes to Drones: Self-Supervised Active Triangulation for 3D Human Pose Reconstruction,"Aleksis Pirinen, Erik Gärtner, Cristian Sminchisescu","Existing state-of-the-art estimation systems can detect 2d poses of multiple people in images quite reliably. In contrast, 3d pose estimation from a single image is ill-posed due to occlusion and depth ambiguities. Assuming access to multiple cameras, or given an active system able to position itself to observe the scene from multiple viewpoints, reconstructing 3d pose from 2d measurements becomes well-posed within the framework of standard multi-view geometry. Less clear is what is an informative set of viewpoints for accurate 3d reconstruction, particularly in complex scenes, where people are occluded by others or by scene objects. In order to address the view selection problem in a principled way, we here introduce ACTOR, an active triangulation agent for 3d human pose reconstruction. Our fully trainable agent consists of a 2d pose estimation network (any of which would work) and a deep reinforcement learning-based policy for camera viewpoint selection. The policy predicts observation viewpoints, the number of which varies adaptively depending on scene content, and the associated images are fed to an underlying pose estimator. Importantly, training the policy requires no annotations - given a 2d pose estimator, ACTOR is trained in a self-supervised manner. In extensive evaluations on complex multi-people scenes filmed in a Panoptic dome, under multiple viewpoints, we compare our active triangulation agent to strong multi-view baselines, and show that ACTOR produces significantly more accurate 3d pose reconstructions. We also provide a proof-of-concept experiment indicating the potential of connecting our view selection policy to a physical drone observer.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/c3e4035af2a1cde9f21e1ae1951ac80b-Paper.pdf,2019,"pose, 3d, 2d, multiple, policy, view, viewpoints, active, actor, agent","actor, pose, 3d, people, active, view, camera, 2d, cameras, agent","{'domes': 0.3766703127869307, 'drones': 0.3766703127869307, 'triangulation': 0.3766703127869307, 'pose': 0.3310783446336019, 'reconstruction': 0.3076923277820601, 'human': 0.29184699413149673, 'active': 0.28353486759468416, '3d': 0.2764145848295889, 'supervised': 0.25514621090261425, 'self': 0.2509973839778379}","{'pose': 0.38566768743234314, 'viewpoints': 0.2929723449234825, '3d': 0.2504085574222964, '2d': 0.22038153567562463, 'view': 0.20484673137695933, 'people': 0.18817572118476986, 'actor': 0.1793169285380995, 'triangulation': 0.1666584157329519, 'scene': 0.16403986542413476, 'active': 0.16168009975935257}"

We present a decentralized algorithm that achieves the same performance as a centralized one,  contradicting the existing lower bounds for that problem. This is possible by ``hacking'' the standard model by constructing a communication protocol between players that deliberately enforces collisions, allowing them to share their information at a negligible cost. 
This motivates the introduction of a more appropriate dynamic setting without sensing, where similar communication protocols are no longer possible.

Latent distance estimation for random geometric graphs,"Ernesto Araya Valdivia, De Castro Yohann","Random geometric graphs are a popular choice for a latent points generative model for networks. Their definition is based on a sample of $n$ points $X_1,X_2,\cdots,X_n$ on the Euclidean sphere~$\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ which represents the latent positions of nodes of the network. The connection probabilities between the nodes are determined by an unknown function (referred to as the ``link'' function) evaluated at the distance between the latent points. We introduce a spectral estimator of the pairwise distance between latent points and we prove that its rate of convergence is the same as the nonparametric estimation of a function on $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$, up to a logarithmic factor. In addition, we provide an efficient spectral algorithm to compute this estimator without any knowledge on the nonparametric link function. As a byproduct, our method can also consistently estimate the dimension $d$ of the latent space.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/c4414e538a5475ec0244673b7f2f7dbb-Paper.pdf,2019,"latent, function, points, distance, estimator, link, mathbb, nodes, nonparametric, spectral","tn, matrix, graphon, model, sd, latent, set, sphere, function, algorithm","{'geometric': 0.47656611928370873, 'distance': 0.44670768792167737, 'graphs': 0.3916828547520197, 'random': 0.3916828547520197, 'latent': 0.38790561898209347, 'estimation': 0.3406395291965847}","{'latent': 0.39179716923755276, 'points': 0.3045957080349094, 'mathbb': 0.22544922672358708, 'function': 0.2244187299031577, 'nonparametric': 0.22307610623185112, 'link': 0.21667603120287235, 'spectral': 0.20624188197521331, 'nodes': 0.1841207406691642, 'estimator': 0.17983670601908427, 'distance': 0.16327473392207048}"
Dual Adversarial Semantics-Consistent Network for Generalized Zero-Shot Learning,"Jian Ni, Shanghang Zhang, Haiyong Xie","Generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) is a challenging class of vision and knowledge transfer problems in which both seen and unseen classes appear during testing. Existing GZSL approaches either suffer from semantic loss and discard discriminative information at the embedding stage, or cannot guarantee the visual-semantic interactions. To address these limitations, we propose a Dual Adversarial Semantics-Consistent Network (referred to as DASCN), which learns both primal and dual Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in a unified framework for GZSL. In DASCN, the primal GAN learns to synthesize inter-class discriminative and semantics-preserving visual features from both the semantic representations of seen/unseen classes and the ones reconstructed by the dual GAN. The dual GAN enforces the synthetic visual features to represent prior semantic knowledge well via semantics-consistent adversarial learning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that employs a novel dual-GAN mechanism for GZSL.

Manipulating a Learning Defender and Ways to Counteract,"Jiarui Gan, Qingyu Guo, Long Tran-Thanh, Bo An, Michael Wooldridge","In Stackelberg security games when information about the attacker's payoffs is uncertain, algorithms have been proposed to learn the optimal defender commitment by interacting with the attacker and observing their best responses. In this paper, we show that, however, these algorithms can be easily manipulated if the attacker responds untruthfully. As a key finding, attacker manipulation normally leads to the defender learning a maximin strategy, which effectively renders the learning attempt meaningless as to compute a maximin strategy requires no additional information about the other player at all. We then apply a game-theoretic framework at a higher level to counteract such manipulation, in which the defender commits to a policy that specifies her strategy commitment according to the learned information. We provide a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the optimal such policy, and in addition, a heuristic approach that applies even when the attacker's payoff space is infinite or completely unknown. Empirical evaluation shows that our approaches can improve the defender's utility significantly as compared to the situation when attacker manipulation is ignored.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/c4819d06b0ca810d38506453cfaae9d8-Paper.pdf,2019,"attacker, defender, information, manipulation, strategy, algorithms, commitment, compute, learning, maximin","attacker, defender, policy, type, strategy, optimal, sse, eop, utility, manipulation","{'counteract': 0.5003239710823616, 'defender': 0.5003239710823616, 'manipulating': 0.5003239710823616, 'ways': 0.4735262136023402, 'learning': 0.15748237016428107}","{'attacker': 0.5213515577908597, 'defender': 0.4254848899669496, 'manipulation': 0.24725167202545212, 'commitment': 0.2127424449834748, 'maximin': 0.2127424449834748, 'strategy': 0.16984797596906429, 'information': 0.12692814097811145, 'compute': 0.11909855455058461, 'commits': 0.1063712224917374, 'counteract': 0.1063712224917374}"
Privacy Amplification by Mixing and Diffusion Mechanisms,"Borja Balle, Gilles Barthe, Marco Gaboardi, Joseph Geumlek","A fundamental result in differential privacy states that the privacy guarantees of a mechanism are preserved by any post-processing of its output. In this paper we investigate under what conditions stochastic post-processing can amplify the privacy of a mechanism. By interpreting post-processing as the application of a Markov operator, we first give a series of amplification results in terms of uniform mixing properties of the Markov process defined by said operator. Next we provide amplification bounds in terms of coupling arguments which can be applied in cases where uniform mixing is not available. Finally, we introduce a new family of mechanisms based on diffusion processes which are closed under post-processing, and analyze their privacy via a novel heat flow argument. On the applied side, we generalize the analysis of ""privacy amplification by iteration"" in Noisy SGD and show it admits an exponential improvement in the strongly convex case, and study a mechanism based on the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck diffusion process which contains the Gaussian mechanism with optimal post-processing on bounded inputs as a special case.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/c4c42505a03f2e969b4c0a97ee9b34e7-Paper.pdf,2019,"post, privacy, processing, mechanism, amplification, applied, based, case, diffusion, markov","mechanism, ampliﬁcation, markov, privacy, σ2, rd, operator, post, pt, dp","{'amplification': 0.48376508343818003, 'mixing': 0.48376508343818003, 'mechanisms': 0.45785423340388376, 'diffusion': 0.4394701927360364, 'privacy': 0.3594136040035134}","{'post': 0.42804932946101576, 'privacy': 0.3399572579626521, 'processing': 0.3268602291489977, 'amplification': 0.2916777543214057, 'mechanism': 0.24572161915809876, 'diffusion': 0.1712197317844063, 'mixing': 0.16899300304110332, 'operator': 0.15279772787918625, 'uniform': 0.14061468219068585, 'markov': 0.12106642049278045}"
Ultra Fast Medoid Identification via Correlated Sequential Halving,"Tavor Baharav, David Tse","The medoid of a set of n points is the point in the set that minimizes the sum of distances to other points. It can be determined exactly in O(n^2) time by computing the distances between all pairs of points. Previous works show that one can significantly reduce the number of distance computations needed by adaptively querying distances. The resulting randomized algorithm is obtained by a direct conversion of the computation problem to a multi-armed bandit statistical inference problem. In this work, we show that we can better exploit the structure of the underlying computation problem by modifying the traditional bandit sampling strategy and using it in conjunction with a suitably chosen multi-armed bandit algorithm. Four to five orders of magnitude gains over exact computation are obtained on real data, in terms of both number of distance computations needed and wall clock time.

Surround Modulation: A Bio-inspired Connectivity Structure for Convolutional Neural Networks,"Hosein Hasani, Mahdieh Soleymani, Hamid Aghajan","Numerous neurophysiological studies have revealed that a large number of the primary visual cortex neurons operate in a regime called surround modulation. Surround modulation has a substantial effect on various perceptual tasks, and it also plays a crucial role in the efficient neural coding of the visual cortex. Inspired by the notion of surround modulation, we designed new excitatory-inhibitory connections between a unit and its surrounding units in the convolutional neural network (CNN) to achieve a more biologically plausible network. Our experiments show that this simple mechanism can considerably improve both the performance and training speed of traditional CNNs in visual tasks. We further explore additional outcomes of the proposed structure. We first evaluate the model under several visual challenges, such as the presence of clutter or change in lighting conditions and show its superior generalization capability in handling these challenging situations. We then study possible changes in the statistics of neural activities such as sparsity and decorrelation and provide further insight into the underlying efficiencies of surround modulation.

Rethinking Kernel Methods for Node Representation Learning on Graphs,"Yu Tian, Long Zhao, Xi Peng, Dimitris Metaxas","Graph kernels are kernel methods measuring graph similarity and serve as a standard tool for graph classification. However, the use of kernel methods for node classification, which is a related problem to graph representation learning, is still ill-posed and the state-of-the-art methods are heavily based on heuristics. Here, we present a novel theoretical kernel-based framework for node classification that can bridge the gap between these two representation learning problems on graphs. Our approach is motivated by graph kernel methodology but extended to learn the node representations capturing the structural information in a graph. We theoretically show that our formulation is as powerful as any positive semidefinite kernels. To efficiently learn the kernel, we propose a novel mechanism for node feature aggregation and a data-driven similarity metric employed during the training phase.

Input Similarity from the Neural Network Perspective,"Guillaume Charpiat, Nicolas Girard, Loris Felardos, Yuliya Tarabalka","Given a trained neural network, we aim at understanding how similar it considers any two samples. For this, we express a proper definition of similarity from the neural network perspective (i.e. we quantify how undissociable two inputs A and B are), by taking a machine learning viewpoint: how much a parameter variation designed to change the output for A would impact the output for B as well?We study the mathematical properties of this similarity measure, and show how to estimate sample density with it, in low complexity, enabling new types of statistical analysis for neural networks. We also propose to use it during training, to enforce that examples known to be similar should also be seen as similar by the network.We then study the self-denoising phenomenon encountered in regression tasks when training neural networks on datasets with noisy labels.

Transfer Learning via Minimizing the Performance Gap Between Domains,"Boyu Wang, Jorge Mendez, Mingbo Cai, Eric Eaton","We propose a new principle for transfer learning, based on a straightforward intuition: if two domains are similar to each other, the model trained on one domain should also perform well on the other domain, and vice versa. To formalize this intuition, we define the performance gap as a measure of the discrepancy between the source and target domains. We derive generalization bounds for the instance weighting approach to transfer learning, showing that the performance gap can be viewed as an algorithm-dependent regularizer, which controls the model complexity. Our theoretical analysis provides new insight into transfer learning and motivates a set of general, principled rules for designing new instance weighting schemes for transfer learning. These rules lead to gapBoost, a novel and principled boosting approach for transfer learning. Our experimental evaluation on benchmark data sets shows that gapBoost significantly outperforms previous boosting-based transfer learning algorithms.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/c66dd00e5fc44ba8de89d7713fedcd50-Paper.pdf,2019,"learning, transfer, new, approach, based, boosting, domain, domains, gap, gapboost","learning, transfer, target, gapboost, domain, data, source, domains, loss, performance","{'domains': 0.46738538751587494, 'minimizing': 0.46738538751587494, 'gap': 0.43406203068825766, 'performance': 0.4034016684844901, 'transfer': 0.35050119579862343, 'via': 0.2548457096608529, 'learning': 0.1554400928434413}","{'transfer': 0.5074456052327969, 'gapboost': 0.27992113232102933, 'intuition': 0.216885000724729, 'boosting': 0.2136675983206637, 'weighting': 0.2054164635462357, 'learning': 0.18437736907800184, 'principled': 0.18368199278893485, 'rules': 0.1810396688715054, 'instance': 0.16823548124648466, 'gap': 0.15176930423477641}"
Catastrophic Forgetting Meets Negative Transfer: Batch Spectral Shrinkage for Safe Transfer Learning,"Xinyang Chen, Sinan Wang, Bo Fu, Mingsheng Long, Jianmin Wang","Before sufficient training data is available, fine-tuning neural networks pre-trained on large-scale datasets substantially outperforms training from random initialization. However, fine-tuning methods suffer from two dilemmas, catastrophic forgetting and negative transfer. While several methods with explicit attempts to overcome catastrophic forgetting have been proposed, negative transfer is rarely delved into. In this paper, we launch an in-depth empirical investigation into negative transfer in fine-tuning and find that, for the weight parameters and feature representations, transferability of their spectral components is diverse. For safe transfer learning, we present Batch Spectral Shrinkage (BSS), a novel regularization approach to penalizing smaller singular values so that untransferable spectral components are suppressed. BSS is orthogonal to existing fine-tuning methods and is readily pluggable to them.

Efficiently Learning Fourier Sparse Set Functions,"Andisheh Amrollahi, Amir Zandieh, Michael Kapralov, Andreas Krause","Learning set functions is a key challenge arising in many domains, ranging from sketching graphs to black-box optimization with discrete parameters. In this paper we consider the problem of efficiently learning set functions that are defined over a ground set of size $n$ and that are sparse (say $k$-sparse) in the Fourier domain. This is a wide class, that includes graph and hypergraph cut functions, decision trees and more. Our central contribution is the first algorithm that allows learning functions whose Fourier support only contains low degree (say degree $d=o(n)$) polynomials using $O(k d \log n)$ sample complexity and runtime $O( kn \log^2 k \log n \log d)$. This implies that sparse graphs with $k$ edges can, for the first time, be learned from $O(k \log n)$ observations of cut values and in linear time in the number of vertices. 
 Our algorithm can also efficiently learn (sums of) decision trees of small depth.
 The algorithm exploits techniques from the sparse Fourier transform literature and is easily implementable. Lastly, we also develop an efficient robust version of our algorithm and prove $\ell_2/\ell_2$ approximation guarantees without any statistical assumptions on the noise.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/c77331e51c5555f8f935d3344c964bd5-Paper.pdf,2019,"log, algorithm, functions, sparse, fourier, learning, set, also, cut, decision","log, every, algorithm, fn, fourier, sparse, set, function, log2, functions","{'fourier': 0.5047604218344764, 'set': 0.46368575947580853, 'efficiently': 0.4538848264346415, 'functions': 0.4077462274205472, 'sparse': 0.3568706320207123, 'learning': 0.17489243370331395}","{'fourier': 0.319479895730988, 'log': 0.318151689212657, 'sparse': 0.25762205185014747, 'say': 0.23185358279295526, 'functions': 0.21371952194732757, 'cut': 0.212986597153992, 'ell_2': 0.1896177105299044, 'trees': 0.17932201959212493, 'degree': 0.17006960724371742, 'algorithm': 0.15022013537663678}"

In this paper, we instead use efficient truncated randomized search in this reward function to train structured prediction energy networks (SPENs), which provide efficient test-time inference using gradient-based search on a smooth, learned representation of the score landscape, and have previously yielded state-of-the-art results in structured prediction.

Planning with Goal-Conditioned Policies,"Soroush Nasiriany, Vitchyr Pong, Steven Lin, Sergey Levine","Planning methods can solve temporally extended sequential decision making problems by composing simple behaviors. However, planning requires suitable abstractions for the states and transitions, which typically need to be designed by hand. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) can acquire behaviors from low-level inputs directly, but struggles with temporally extended tasks. Can we utilize reinforcement learning to automatically form the abstractions needed for planning, thus obtaining the best of both approaches? We show that goal-conditioned policies learned with RL can be incorporated into planning, such that a planner can focus on which states to reach, rather than how those states are reached. However, with complex state observations such as images, not all inputs represent valid states. We therefore also propose using a latent variable model to compactly represent the set of valid states for the planner, such that the policies provide an abstraction of actions, and the latent variable model provides an abstraction of states. We compare our method with planning-based and model-free methods and find that our method significantly outperforms prior work when evaluated on image-based tasks that require non-greedy, multi-staged behavior.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/c8cc6e90ccbff44c9cee23611711cdc4-Paper.pdf,2019,"states, planning, model, abstraction, abstractions, based, behaviors, extended, however, inputs","goal, planning, state, subgoals, model, latent, conditioned, states, method, dimensional","{'conditioned': 0.5145453286346912, 'goal': 0.5145453286346912, 'policies': 0.5145453286346912, 'planning': 0.45357393481179326}","{'states': 0.40544423812579683, 'planning': 0.39119144570136527, 'abstractions': 0.2204620749963877, 'planner': 0.2204620749963877, 'abstraction': 0.19028144924208798, 'temporally': 0.18341520622270382, 'behaviors': 0.17093883416644248, 'valid': 0.17093883416644248, 'extended': 0.14153725051895882, 'rl': 0.13925690970926768}"
Goal-conditioned Imitation Learning,"Yiming Ding, Carlos Florensa, Pieter Abbeel, Mariano Phielipp","Designing rewards for Reinforcement Learning (RL) is challenging because it needs to convey the desired task, be efficient to optimize, and be easy to compute. The latter is particularly problematic when applying RL to robotics, where detecting whether the desired configuration is reached might require considerable supervision and instrumentation. Furthermore, we are often interested in being able to reach a wide range of configurations, hence setting up a different reward every time might be unpractical. Methods like Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) have recently shown promise to learn policies able to reach many goals, without the need of a reward. Unfortunately, without tricks like resetting to points along the trajectory, HER might require many samples to discover how to reach certain areas of the state-space. In this work we propose a novel algorithm goalGAIL, which incorporates demonstrations to drastically speed up the convergence to a policy able to reach any goal, surpassing the performance of an agent trained with other Imitation Learning algorithms.

Superset Technique for Approximate Recovery in One-Bit Compressed Sensing,"Larkin Flodin, Venkata Gandikota, Arya Mazumdar","One-bit compressed sensing (1bCS) is a method of signal acquisition under extreme measurement quantization that gives important insights on the limits of signal compression and analog-to-digital conversion.

We construct 1bCS matrices that are universal - i.e. work for all signals under a model - and at the same time recover very general random sparse signals with high probability. In our approach, we divide the set of samples (measurements) into two parts, and use the first part to recover the superset of the support of a sparse vector.

Iterative Least Trimmed Squares for Mixed Linear Regression,"Yanyao Shen, Sujay Sanghavi","Given a linear regression setting, Iterative Least Trimmed Squares (ILTS) involves alternating between (a) selecting the subset of samples with lowest current loss, and (b) re-fitting the linear model only on that subset.

We first establish deterministic conditions (on the features etc.) under which the ILTS iterate converges linearly to the closest mixture component. We also provide a global algorithm that uses ILTS as a subroutine, to fully solve mixed linear regressions with corruptions. We then evaluate it for the widely studied setting of isotropic Gaussian features, and establish that we match or better existing results in terms of sample complexity.

Asymptotic Guarantees for Learning Generative Models with the Sliced-Wasserstein Distance,"Kimia Nadjahi, Alain Durmus, Umut Simsekli, Roland Badeau","Minimum expected distance estimation (MEDE) algorithms have been widely used for probabilistic models with intractable likelihood functions and they have become increasingly popular due to their use in implicit generative modeling (e.g.\ Wasserstein generative adversarial networks, Wasserstein autoencoders). Emerging from computational optimal transport, the Sliced-Wasserstein (SW) distance has become a popular choice in MEDE thanks to its simplicity and computational benefits. While several studies have reported empirical success on generative modeling with SW, the theoretical properties of such estimators have not yet been established. In this study, we investigate the asymptotic properties of estimators that are obtained by minimizing SW. We first show that convergence in SW implies weak convergence of probability measures in general Wasserstein spaces.

Time-series Generative Adversarial Networks,"Jinsung Yoon, Daniel Jarrett, Mihaela van der Schaar","A good generative model for time-series data should preserve temporal dynamics, in the sense that new sequences respect the original relationships between variables across time. Existing methods that bring generative adversarial networks (GANs) into the sequential setting do not adequately attend to the temporal correlations unique to time-series data. At the same time, supervised models for sequence prediction - which allow finer control over network dynamics - are inherently deterministic. We propose a novel framework for generating realistic time-series data that combines the flexibility of the unsupervised paradigm with the control afforded by supervised training. Through a learned embedding space jointly optimized with both supervised and adversarial objectives, we encourage the network to adhere to the dynamics of the training data during sampling. Empirically, we evaluate the ability of our method to generate realistic samples using a variety of real and synthetic time-series datasets.

Dynamics of stochastic gradient descent for two-layer neural networks in the teacher-student setup,"Sebastian Goldt, Madhu Advani, Andrew M. Saxe, Florent Krzakala, Lenka Zdeborová","Deep neural networks achieve stellar generalisation even when they have enough
parameters to easily fit all their training data. We study this phenomenon by
analysing the dynamics and the performance of over-parameterised two-layer
neural networks in the teacher-student setup, where one network, the student,
is trained on data generated by another network, called the teacher. We show
how the dynamics of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is captured by a set of
differential equations and prove that this description is asymptotically exact
in the limit of large inputs. Using this framework, we calculate the final
generalisation error of student networks that have more parameters than their
teachers. We find that the final generalisation error of the student increases
with network size when training only the first layer, but stays constant or
even decreases with size when training both layers. We show that these
different behaviours have their root in the different solutions SGD finds for
different activation functions. Our results indicate that achieving good
generalisation in neural networks goes beyond the properties of SGD alone and
depends on the interplay of at least the algorithm, the model architecture,

Learning Nonsymmetric Determinantal Point Processes,"Mike Gartrell, Victor-Emmanuel Brunel, Elvis Dohmatob, Syrine Krichene","Determinantal point processes (DPPs) have attracted substantial attention as an elegant probabilistic model that captures the balance between quality and diversity within sets.  DPPs are conventionally parameterized by a positive semi-definite kernel matrix, and this symmetric kernel encodes only repulsive interactions between items.  These so-called symmetric DPPs have significant expressive power, and have been successfully applied to a variety of machine learning tasks, including recommendation systems, information retrieval, and automatic summarization, among many others.  Efficient algorithms for learning symmetric DPPs and sampling from these models have been reasonably well studied.  However, relatively little attention has been given to nonsymmetric DPPs, which relax the symmetric constraint on the kernel. Nonsymmetric DPPs allow for both repulsive and attractive item interactions, which can significantly improve modeling power, resulting in a model that may better fit for some applications.  We present a method that enables a tractable algorithm, based on maximum likelihood estimation, for learning nonsymmetric DPPs from data composed of observed subsets. Our method imposes a particular decomposition of the nonsymmetric kernel that enables such tractable learning algorithms, which we analyze both theoretically and experimentally.

In this paper, we adopt a novel perspective and regard the omnipresence of adversarial perturbations as a strength rather than a weakness. We postulate that if an image has been tampered with, these adversarial directions either become harder to find with gradient methods or have substantially higher density than for natural images.

Hamiltonian descent for composite objectives,"Brendan O'Donoghue, Chris J. Maddison","In optimization the duality gap between the primal and the dual problems is a measure of the suboptimality of any primal-dual point. In classical mechanics the equations of motion of a system can be derived from the Hamiltonian function, which is a quantity that describes the total energy of the system.  In this paper we consider a convex optimization problem consisting of the sum of two convex functions, sometimes referred to as a composite objective, and we identify the duality gap to be the `energy' of the system.  In the Hamiltonian formalism the energy is conserved, so we add a contractive term to the standard equations of motion so that this energy decreases linearly (ie, geometrically) with time.  This yields a continuous-time ordinary differential equation (ODE) in the primal and dual variables which converges to zero duality gap, ie, optimality.  This ODE has several useful properties: it induces a natural operator splitting; at convergence it yields both the primal and dual solutions; and it is invariant to affine transformation despite only using first order information.  We provide several discretizations of this ODE, some of which are new algorithms and others correspond to known techniques, such as the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).  We conclude with some numerical examples that show the promise of our approach. We give an example where our technique can solve a convex quadratic minimization problem orders of magnitude faster than several commonly-used gradient methods, including conjugate gradient, when the conditioning of the problem is poor.

Divergence-Augmented Policy Optimization,"Qing Wang, Yingru Li, Jiechao Xiong, Tong Zhang","In deep reinforcement learning, policy optimization methods need to deal with issues such as function approximation and the reuse of off-policy data. Standard policy gradient methods do not handle off-policy data well, leading to premature convergence and instability. This paper introduces a method to stabilize policy optimization when off-policy data are reused. The idea is to include a Bregman divergence between the behavior policy that generates the data and the current policy to ensure small and safe policy updates with off-policy data. The Bregman divergence is calculated between the state distributions of two policies, instead of only on the action probabilities, leading to a divergence augmentation formulation.
Empirical experiments on Atari games show that in the data-scarce scenario where the reuse of off-policy data becomes necessary, our method can achieve better performance than other state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/cc9657884708170e160c8372d92f3535-Paper.pdf,2019,"policy, data, divergence, bregman, deep, leading, learning, method, methods, optimization","policy, al, divergence, et, ppo, optimization, method, µt, state, algorithm","{'divergence': 0.6119035714333079, 'augmented': 0.5621101813308482, 'policy': 0.42970433624756493, 'optimization': 0.35349730794081474}","{'policy': 0.6727261677751779, 'data': 0.24111306448740685, 'divergence': 0.2339727653738002, 'bregman': 0.21180471503521667, 'reuse': 0.19665096739932075, 'leading': 0.15690045155991714, 'premature': 0.1269031082889618, 'scarce': 0.1201060749346901, 'reused': 0.11528350302214187, 'reinforcement': 0.11333926908985772}"
Gaussian-Based Pooling for Convolutional Neural Networks,Takumi Kobayashi,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) contain local pooling to effectively downsize feature maps for increasing computation efficiency as well as robustness to input variations. The local pooling methods are generally formulated in a form of convex combination of local neuron activations for retaining the characteristics of an input feature map in a manner similar to image downscaling. In this paper, to improve performance of CNNs, we propose a novel local pooling method based on the Gaussian-based probabilistic model over local neuron activations for flexibly pooling (extracting) features, in contrast to the previous model restricting the output within the convex hull of local neurons. In the proposed method, the local neuron activations are aggregated into the statistics of mean and standard deviation in a Gaussian distribution, and then on the basis of those statistics, we construct the probabilistic model suitable for the pooling in accordance with the knowledge about local pooling in CNNs. Through the probabilistic model equipped with trainable parameters, the proposed method naturally integrates two schemes of adaptively training the pooling form based on input feature maps and stochastically performing the pooling throughout the end-to-end learning. The experimental results on image classification demonstrate that the proposed method favorably improves performance of various CNNs in comparison with the other pooling methods.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/cca289d2a4acd14c1cd9a84ffb41dd29-Paper.pdf,2019,"pooling, local, cnns, method, model, activations, based, feature, input, neuron","pooling, gaussian, model, local, σ0, isp, methods, stochastic, method, half","{'pooling': 0.5937397242073035, 'gaussian': 0.4452567172325993, 'convolutional': 0.4365254971944435, 'based': 0.3401352546584754, 'networks': 0.26736968273819145, 'neural': 0.26736968273819145}","{'pooling': 0.6343458659723346, 'local': 0.3378954256881254, 'cnns': 0.24463901310792452, 'neuron': 0.20214163660440335, 'activations': 0.18190239910455963, 'probabilistic': 0.14848480477666415, 'feature': 0.12736772054346565, 'input': 0.12128903924742541, 'maps': 0.11345837483594283, 'statistics': 0.1100249630316085}"
Band-Limited Gaussian Processes: The Sinc Kernel,Felipe Tobar,"We propose a novel class of Gaussian processes (GPs) whose spectra have compact support, meaning that their sample trajectories are almost-surely band limited. As a complement to the growing literature on spectral design of covariance kernels, the core of our proposal is to model power spectral densities through a rectangular function, which results in a kernel based on the sinc function with straightforward extensions to non-centred (around zero frequency) and frequency-varying cases. In addition to its use in regression, the relationship between the sinc kernel and the classic theory is illuminated, in particular, the Shannon-Nyquist theorem is interpreted as posterior reconstruction under the proposed kernel. Additionally, we show that the sinc kernel is instrumental in two fundamental signal processing applications: first, in stereo amplitude modulation, where the non-centred sinc kernel arises naturally. Second, for band-pass filtering, where the proposed kernel allows for a Bayesian treatment that is robust to observation noise and missing data.

Towards closing the gap between the theory and practice of SVRG,"Othmane Sebbouh, Nidham Gazagnadou, Samy Jelassi, Francis Bach, Robert Gower","Amongst the very first variance reduced stochastic methods for solving the empirical risk minimization problem was the SVRG method. SVRG is an inner-outer loop based method, where in the outer loop a reference full gradient is evaluated, after which $m \in \N$ steps of an inner loop are executed where the reference gradient is used to build a variance reduced estimate of the current gradient.
The simplicity of the SVRG method and its analysis have lead to multiple extensions and variants for even non-convex optimization. Yet there is a significant gap between the parameter settings that the analysis suggests and what is known to work well in practice. Our first contribution is that we take several steps towards closing this gap. In particular, the current analysis shows that $m$ should be of the order of the condition number so that the resulting method has a favorable complexity. Yet in practice $m=n$ works well regardless of the condition number, where $n$ is the number of data points. Furthermore, the current analysis shows that the inner iterates have to be reset using averaging after every outer loop. Yet in practice SVRG works best when the inner iterates are updated continuously and not reset. We provide an analysis of these aforementioned practical settings and show that they achieve the same favorable complexity as the original analysis (with slightly better constants). Our second contribution is to  provide a more general analysis than had been previously done by using arbitrary sampling, which allows us to analyze virtually all forms of mini-batching through a single theorem. Since our setup and analysis reflect what is done in practice, we are able to set the parameters such as the mini-batch size and step size using our theory in such a way that produces a more efficient algorithm in practice, as we show in extensive numerical experiments.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/cd00692c3bfe59267d5ecfac5310286c-Paper.pdf,2019,"analysis, practice, inner, loop, method, svrg, current, gradient, number, outer","svrg, mini, sampling, size, complexity, batch, 10, analysis, loop, step","{'closing': 0.45525384356132215, 'practice': 0.45525384356132215, 'svrg': 0.43087007864753674, 'gap': 0.4001501679258355, 'theory': 0.3648019922879756, 'towards': 0.32655505003475527}","{'svrg': 0.325372064353424, 'analysis': 0.2775907606579324, 'loop': 0.26849455613458517, 'inner': 0.2600911622510453, 'outer': 0.24402904826506797, 'practice': 0.23724228238840647, 'reset': 0.17517559430795335, 'yet': 0.15228979826550346, 'iterates': 0.14128103469727865, 'reference': 0.14128103469727865}"
A Unifying Framework for Spectrum-Preserving Graph Sparsification and Coarsening,"Gecia Bravo Hermsdorff, Lee Gunderson","How might one ``reduce'' a graph? 
That is, generate a smaller graph that preserves the global structure at the expense of discarding local details?  
There has been extensive work on both graph sparsification (removing edges) and graph coarsening (merging nodes, often by edge contraction); however, these operations are currently treated separately.  
Interestingly, for a planar graph, edge deletion corresponds to edge contraction in its planar dual (and more generally, for a graphical matroid and its dual).  
Moreover, with respect to the dynamics induced by the graph Laplacian (e.g., diffusion), deletion and contraction are physical manifestations of two reciprocal limits: edge weights of $0$ and $\infty$, respectively.  
In this work, we provide a unifying framework that captures both of these operations, allowing one to simultaneously sparsify and coarsen a graph while preserving its large-scale structure.  
The limit of infinite edge weight is rarely considered, as many classical notions of graph similarity diverge.  However, its algebraic, geometric, and physical interpretations are reflected in the Laplacian pseudoinverse $\mat{L}^\dagger$, which remains finite in this limit.  
Motivated by this insight, we provide a probabilistic algorithm that reduces graphs while preserving $\mat{L}^\dagger$, using an unbiased procedure that minimizes its variance. 
We compare our algorithm with several existing sparsification and coarsening algorithms using real-world datasets, and demonstrate that it more accurately preserves the large-scale structure.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/cd474f6341aeffd65f93084d0dae3453-Paper.pdf,2019,"graph, edge, contraction, structure, algorithm, coarsening, dagger, deletion, dual, however","graph, edges, edge, princeton, nodes, algorithm, error, coarsening, fraction, sparsiﬁcation","{'coarsening': 0.43991929402482394, 'spectrum': 0.43991929402482394, 'unifying': 0.4163568600152034, 'sparsification': 0.3996390470336541, 'preserving': 0.3671185913636371, 'framework': 0.293143866700395, 'graph': 0.24324522602681034}","{'graph': 0.3468833469428013, 'edge': 0.3354446659506529, 'contraction': 0.24958044378157332, 'coarsening': 0.19463277574911828, 'mat': 0.1842080865004601, 'planar': 0.1842080865004601, 'dagger': 0.17681165176970703, 'deletion': 0.16638696252104887, 'sparsification': 0.16638696252104887, 'preserves': 0.1624236796083306}"
Error Correcting Output Codes Improve Probability Estimation and Adversarial Robustness of Deep Neural Networks,"Gunjan Verma, Ananthram Swami","Modern machine learning systems are susceptible to adversarial examples; inputs
which clearly preserve the characteristic semantics of a given class, but whose
classification is (usually confidently) incorrect. Existing approaches to adversarial
defense generally rely on modifying the input, e.g. quantization, or the learned
model parameters, e.g. via adversarial training. However, recent research has
shown that most such approaches succumb to adversarial examples when different norms or more sophisticated adaptive attacks are considered. In this paper, we propose a fundamentally different approach which instead changes the way the output is represented and decoded. This simple approach achieves state-of-the-art robustness to adversarial examples for L 2 and L ∞ based adversarial perturbations on MNIST and CIFAR10. In addition, even under strong white-box attacks, we find that our model often assigns adversarial examples a low probability; those with high probability are usually interpretable, i.e. perturbed towards the perceptual boundary between the original and adversarial class. Our approach has several advantages: it yields more meaningful probability estimates, is extremely fast during training and testing, requires essentially no architectural changes to existing discriminative learning pipelines, is wholly complementary to other defense approaches including adversarial training, and does not sacrifice benign test set performance",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/cd61a580392a70389e27b0bc2b439f49-Paper.pdf,2019,"adversarial, examples, approach, approaches, probability, training, attacks, changes, class, defense","model, adversarial, probability, class, softmax, examples, models, figure, output, logits","{'correcting': 0.3758819599637693, 'improve': 0.3607893196993984, 'probability': 0.3607893196993984, 'codes': 0.3490825584174139, 'output': 0.3395174379854049, 'error': 0.3031529160070406, 'robustness': 0.26258912021780856, 'estimation': 0.24267998825264483, 'adversarial': 0.22233667795680093, 'deep': 0.18644267855409116}","{'adversarial': 0.48021834865844204, 'examples': 0.24572247462709323, 'defense': 0.19824073039155493, 'probability': 0.1740218401363861, 'attacks': 0.15281296725414528, 'approaches': 0.14711191522041836, 'changes': 0.14432755409077397, 'usually': 0.14014018199592895, 'decoded': 0.12134101370344644, 'training': 0.11608087249355946}"

On Human-Aligned Risk Minimization,"Liu Leqi, Adarsh Prasad, Pradeep K.

However, seminal results in behavioral economics have shown that human decision-making is based on different risk measures than the expectation of any given loss function. In this paper, we pose the following simple question: in contrast to minimizing expected loss, could we minimize a better human-aligned risk measure? While this might not seem natural at first glance, we analyze the properties of such a revised risk measure, and surprisingly show that it might also better align with additional desiderata like fairness that have attracted considerable recent attention. We focus in particular on a class of human-aligned risk measures inspired by cumulative prospect theory.

Robustness Verification of Tree-based Models,"Hongge Chen, Huan Zhang, Si Si, Yang Li, Duane Boning, Cho-Jui Hsieh","We study the robustness verification problem of tree based models, including random forest (RF) and gradient boosted decision tree (GBDT).
Formal robustness verification of decision tree ensembles involves finding the exact minimal adversarial perturbation or a guaranteed lower bound of it. Existing approaches cast this verification problem into a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem, which finds the minimal adversarial distortion in exponential time so is impractical for large ensembles. Although this verification problem is NP-complete in general, we give a more precise complexity characterization. We show that there is a simple linear time algorithm for verifying a single tree, and for tree ensembles the verification problem can be cast as a max-clique problem on a multi-partite boxicity graph. For low dimensional problems when boxicity can be viewed as constant, this reformulation leads to a polynomial time algorithm. For general problems, by exploiting the boxicity of the graph, we devise an efficient verification algorithm that can give tight lower bounds on robustness of decision tree ensembles, and allows iterative improvement and any-time termination. On RF/GBDT models trained on a variety of datasets, we significantly outperform the lower bounds obtained by relaxing the MILP formulation into a linear program (LP), and are hundreds times faster than solving MILPs to get the exact minimal adversarial distortion.

Provable Non-linear Inductive Matrix Completion,"Kai Zhong, Zhao Song, Prateek Jain, Inderjit S. Dhillon","Consider a standard recommendation/retrieval problem where given a query, the goal is to retrieve the most relevant items. Inductive matrix completion (IMC) method is a standard approach for this problem where the given query as well as the items are embedded in a common low-dimensional space. The inner product between a query embedding and an item embedding reflects relevance of the (query, item) pair.  Non-linear IMC (NIMC) uses non-linear networks to embed the query as well as items, and is known to be highly effective for a variety of tasks, such as video recommendations for users, semantic web search, etc. Despite its wide usage, existing literature lacks rigorous understanding of NIMC models. A key challenge in analyzing such models is to deal with the non-convexity arising out of non-linear embeddings in addition to the non-convexity arising out of the low-dimensional restriction of the embedding space, which is akin to the low-rank restriction in the  standard matrix completion problem.  In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis for a simple NIMC model in the realizable setting, where the relevance score of a (query, item) pair is formulated as the inner product between their single-layer neural representations. Our results show that under mild assumptions we can recover the ground truth parameters of the NIMC model using standard (stochastic) gradient descent methods if the methods are initialized within a small distance to the optimal parameters. We show that a standard tensor method can be used to initialize the solution within the required distance to the optimal parameters. Furthermore, we show that the number of query-item relevance observations required, a key parameter in learning such models, scales nearly linearly with the input dimensionality thus matching existing results for the standard linear inductive matrix completion.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/ce5193a069bea027a60e06c57a106eb6-Paper.pdf,2019,"query, standard, non, item, linear, nimc, completion, embedding, items, low","linear, non, activation, relu, ground, model, truth, hessian, problem, neural","{'completion': 0.46079751579660144, 'inductive': 0.46079751579660144, 'provable': 0.4481713228600448, 'matrix': 0.38949397034011957, 'non': 0.346624061712346, 'linear': 0.3203435205337624}","{'query': 0.3851268169041723, 'nimc': 0.3378516437495199, 'item': 0.25788674370557774, 'relevance': 0.2166160423258547, 'standard': 0.21642234834259633, 'completion': 0.19632749783454095, 'items': 0.17631673041750465, 'imc': 0.16892582187475996, 'non': 0.1516364016424001, 'embedding': 0.1484376417737505}"
STAR-Caps: Capsule Networks with Straight-Through Attentive Routing,"Karim Ahmed, Lorenzo Torresani","Capsule networks have been shown to be powerful models for image classification, thanks to their ability to represent and capture viewpoint variations of an object. However, the high computational complexity of capsule networks that stems from the recurrent dynamic routing poses a major drawback making their use for large-scale image classification challenging. In this work, we propose Star-Caps a capsule-based network that exploits a straight-through attentive routing to address the drawbacks of capsule networks. By utilizing attention modules augmented by differentiable binary routers, the proposed mechanism estimates the routing coefficients between capsules without recurrence, as opposed to prior related work. Subsequently, the routers utilize straight-through estimators to make binary decisions to either connect or disconnect the route between capsules, allowing stable and faster performance. The experiments conducted on several image classification datasets, including MNIST, SmallNorb, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet show that Star-Caps outperforms the baseline capsule networks.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/cf040fc71060367913e81ac1eb050aea-Paper.pdf,2019,"capsule, networks, classification, image, routing, binary, caps, capsules, cifar, routers","capsule, routing, capsules, attention, caps, star, level, emcaps, 32, networks","{'caps': 0.4178323503525752, 'star': 0.4178323503525752, 'straight': 0.4178323503525752, 'attentive': 0.3954529109508752, 'capsule': 0.3795744460012534, 'routing': 0.3795744460012534, 'networks': 0.17807823028851869}","{'capsule': 0.49556734611362535, 'routing': 0.28230457654243685, 'caps': 0.22552427278103926, 'routers': 0.22552427278103926, 'star': 0.21344500990908383, 'capsules': 0.20487463651022905, 'straight': 0.20487463651022905, 'binary': 0.14111965183876735, 'image': 0.1392363645247704, 'networks': 0.1388912685405671}"
Self-attention with Functional Time Representation Learning,"Da Xu, Chuanwei Ruan, Evren Korpeoglu, Sushant Kumar, Kannan Achan","Sequential modelling with self-attention has achieved cutting edge performances 
in natural language processing. With advantages in model flexibility, computation complexity and interpretability, self-attention is gradually becoming a key component in event sequence models. However, like most other sequence models, self-attention does not account for the time span between events and thus captures sequential signals rather than temporal patterns. 
Without relying on recurrent network structures, self-attention recognizes event orderings via positional encoding. To bridge the gap between modelling time-independent and time-dependent event sequence, we introduce a functional feature map that embeds time span into high-dimensional spaces. By constructing the associated translation-invariant time kernel function, we reveal the functional forms of the feature map under classic functional function analysis results, namely Bochner's Theorem and Mercer's Theorem. We propose several models to learn the functional time representation and the interactions with event representation. These methods are evaluated on real-world datasets under various continuous-time event sequence prediction tasks.

Multi-label Co-regularization for Semi-supervised Facial Action Unit Recognition,"Xuesong Niu, Hu Han, Shiguang Shan, Xilin Chen","Facial action units (AUs) recognition is essential for emotion analysis and has been widely applied in mental state analysis. Existing work on AU recognition usually requires big face dataset with accurate AU labels. However, manual AU annotation requires expertise and can be time-consuming. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised approach for AU recognition utilizing a large number of web face images without AU labels and a small face dataset with AU labels inspired by the co-training methods. Unlike traditional co-training methods that require provided multi-view features and model re-training, we propose a novel co-training method, namely multi-label co-regularization, for semi-supervised facial AU recognition. Two deep neural networks are used to generate multi-view features for both labeled and unlabeled face images, and a multi-view loss is designed to enforce the generated features from the two views to be conditionally independent representations. In order to obtain consistent predictions from the two views, we further design a multi-label co-regularization loss aiming to minimize the distance between the predicted AU probability distributions of the two views. In addition, prior knowledge of the relationship between individual AUs is embedded through a graph convolutional network (GCN) for exploiting useful information from the big unlabeled dataset. Experiments on several benchmarks show that the proposed approach can effectively leverage large datasets of unlabeled face images to improve the AU recognition robustness and outperform the state-of-the-art semi-supervised AU recognition methods.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/cf67355a3333e6e143439161adc2d82e-Paper.pdf,2019,"au, recognition, co, face, multi, training, two, dataset, features, images","au, images, co, training, recognition, face, multi, two, supervised, unlabeled","{'unit': 0.3946808953473746, 'action': 0.3735414666435367, 'facial': 0.3735414666435367, 'co': 0.3224047112235148, 'recognition': 0.30580172909303865, 'label': 0.3012652825196769, 'semi': 0.280125853815839, 'regularization': 0.2773069918560752, 'supervised': 0.26734608899347245, 'multi': 0.22382287069888815}","{'au': 0.6794873594727191, 'recognition': 0.2567173532927912, 'face': 0.2464200211516289, 'co': 0.2411340135450915, 'views': 0.15344322498492663, 'multi': 0.14568009506764654, 'aus': 0.13589747189454382, 'unlabeled': 0.1283586766463956, 'view': 0.12527789009735546, 'semi': 0.12317857945081102}"
A Primal Dual Formulation For Deep Learning With Constraints,"Yatin Nandwani, Abhishek Pathak, Mausam, Parag Singla","For several problems of interest, there are natural constraints which exist over the output label space. For example, for the joint task of NER and POS labeling, these constraints might specify that the NER label ‘organization’ is consistent only with the POS labels ‘noun’ and ‘preposition’. These constraints can be a great way of injecting prior knowledge into a deep learning model, thereby improving overall performance. In this paper, we present a constrained optimization formulation for training a deep network with a given set of hard constraints on output labels. Our novel approach first converts the label constraints into soft logic constraints over probability distributions outputted by the network. It then converts the constrained optimization problem into an alternating min-max optimization with Lagrangian variables defined for each constraint.  Since the constraints are independent of the target labels,  our framework easily generalizes to semi-supervised setting. We experiment on the tasks of Semantic Role Labeling (SRL), Named Entity Recognition (NER) tagging,  and fine-grained entity typing and show that our constraints not only significantly reduce the number of constraint violations, but can also result in state-of-the-art performance",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/cf708fc1decf0337aded484f8f4519ae-Paper.pdf,2019,"constraints, label, labels, ner, optimization, constrained, constraint, converts, deep, entity","constraints, learning, constraint, data, constrained, training, al, et, formulation, model","{'formulation': 0.52297818909311, 'primal': 0.4856912107799105, 'dual': 0.4513839749728848, 'constraints': 0.43509593386554435, 'deep': 0.25940445348663665, 'learning': 0.17392879717482976}","{'constraints': 0.47488151407006085, 'ner': 0.32444137153643315, 'converts': 0.21629424769095545, 'pos': 0.21629424769095545, 'label': 0.20387085817327982, 'entity': 0.19536896326200953, 'labels': 0.18878500953597754, 'labeling': 0.16979005416175647, 'constraint': 0.13964566294646114, 'constrained': 0.1325931099751718}"
DualDICE: Behavior-Agnostic Estimation of Discounted Stationary Distribution Corrections,"Ofir Nachum, Yinlam Chow, Bo Dai, Lihong Li","In many real-world reinforcement learning applications, access to the environment is limited to a fixed dataset, instead of direct (online) interaction with the environment.  When using this data for either evaluation or training of a new policy, accurate estimates of discounted stationary distribution ratios -- correction terms which quantify the likelihood that the new policy will experience a certain state-action pair normalized by the probability with which the state-action pair appears in the dataset -- can improve accuracy and performance. In this work, we propose an algorithm, DualDICE, for estimating these quantities. In contrast to previous approaches, our algorithm is agnostic to knowledge of the behavior policy (or policies) used to generate the dataset. Furthermore, our algorithm eschews any direct use of importance weights, thus avoiding potential optimization instabilities endemic of previous methods.

Across layers, the ID first increases and then progressively decreases in the final layers. Remarkably, the ID of the last hidden layer predicts classification accuracy on the test set.

Discovering Neural Wirings,"Mitchell Wortsman, Ali Farhadi, Mohammad Rastegari","The success of neural networks has driven a shift in focus from feature engineering to architecture engineering. However, successful networks today are constructed using a small and manually defined set of building blocks. Even in methods of neural architecture search (NAS) the network connectivity patterns are largely constrained. In this work we propose a method for discovering neural wirings. We relax the typical notion of layers and instead enable channels to form connections independent of each other. This allows for a much larger space of possible networks. The wiring of our network is not fixed during training -- as we learn the network parameters we also learn the structure itself. Our experiments demonstrate that our learned connectivity outperforms hand engineered and randomly wired networks. By learning the connectivity of MobileNetV1we boost the ImageNet accuracy by 10% at ~41M FLOPs. Moreover, we show that our method generalizes to recurrent and continuous time networks.
Our work may also be regarded as unifying core aspects of the neural architecture search problem with sparse neural network learning. As NAS becomes more fine grained, finding a good architecture is akin to finding a sparse subnetwork of the complete graph. Accordingly, DNW provides an effective mechanism for discovering sparse subnetworks of predefined architectures in a single training run. Though we only ever use a small percentage of the weights during the forward pass, we still play the so-called initialization lottery with a combinatorial number of subnetworks.

Locally Private Learning without Interaction Requires Separation,"Amit Daniely, Vitaly Feldman","We consider learning under the constraint of local differential privacy (LDP). For many learning problems known efficient algorithms in this model require many rounds of communication between the server and the clients holding the data points. Yet multi-round protocols are prohibitively slow in practice due to network latency and, as a result, currently deployed large-scale systems are limited to a single round. Despite significant research interest, very little is known about which learning problems can be solved by such non-interactive systems. The only lower bound we are aware of is for PAC learning an artificial class of functions with respect to a uniform distribution (Kasiviswanathan et al., 2008).We show that the margin complexity of a class of Boolean functions is a lower bound on the complexity of any non-interactive LDP algorithm for distribution-independent PAC learning of the class. In particular, the classes of linear separators and decision lists require exponential number of samples to learn non-interactively even though they can be learned in polynomial time by an interactive LDP algorithm. This gives the first example of a natural problem that is significantly harder to solve without interaction and also resolves an open problem of Kasiviswanathan et al.~(2008). We complement this lower bound with a new efficient learning algorithm whose complexity is polynomial in the margin complexity of the class. Our algorithm is non-interactive on labeled samples but still needs interactive access to unlabeled samples. All of our results also apply to the statistical query model and any model in which the number of bits communicated about each data point is constrained.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/d01c25576ff1c53de58e0e6970a2d510-Paper.pdf,2019,"learning, interactive, algorithm, class, complexity, non, bound, ldp, lower, model","algorithm, learning, non, interactive, ldp, queries, model, distribution, algorithms, oracle","{'requires': 0.44275564347768476, 'interaction': 0.42497785054324105, 'separation': 0.42497785054324105, 'locally': 0.4111883230411916, 'without': 0.3821436657639528, 'private': 0.32551995348261503, 'learning': 0.14724888746503945}","{'interactive': 0.4013338943776213, 'ldp': 0.3058179178199771, 'kasiviswanathan': 0.2038786118799847, '2008': 0.19295870815299768, 'complexity': 0.17520180234674027, 'class': 0.17274505634393403, 'non': 0.14640944165539724, 'round': 0.1462427857449092, 'pac': 0.14186585902929336, 'lower': 0.13974809109674466}"
Fixing the train-test resolution discrepancy,"Hugo Touvron, Andrea Vedaldi, Matthijs Douze, Herve Jegou","Data-augmentation is key to the training of neural networks for image classification. This paper first shows that existing augmentations induce a significant discrepancy between the size of the objects seen by the classifier at train and test time: in fact, a lower train resolution improves the classification at test time!We then propose a simple strategy to optimize the classifier performance, that employs different train and test resolutions. It relies on a computationally cheap fine-tuning of the network at the test resolution. This enables training strong classifiers using small training images, and therefore significantly reduce the training time.

Quadratic Video Interpolation,"Xiangyu Xu, Li Siyao, Wenxiu Sun, Qian Yin, Ming-Hsuan Yang","Video interpolation is an important problem in computer vision, which helps overcome the temporal limitation of camera sensors. Existing video interpolation methods usually assume uniform motion between consecutive frames and use linear models for interpolation, which cannot well approximate the complex motion in the real world. To address these issues, we propose a quadratic video interpolation method which exploits the acceleration information in videos. This method allows prediction with curvilinear trajectory and variable velocity, and generates more accurate interpolation results. For high-quality frame synthesis, we develop a flow reversal layer to estimate flow fields starting from the unknown target frame to the source frame.

Self-supervised GAN: Analysis and Improvement with Multi-class Minimax Game,"Ngoc-Trung Tran, Viet-Hung Tran, Bao-Ngoc Nguyen, Linxiao Yang, Ngai-Man (Man) Cheung","Self-supervised (SS) learning is a powerful approach for representation learning using unlabeled data. Recently, it has been applied to Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) training. Specifically, SS tasks were proposed to address the catastrophic forgetting issue in the GAN discriminator. In this work, we perform an in-depth analysis to understand how SS tasks interact with learning of generator. From the analysis, we identify issues of SS tasks which allow a severely mode-collapsed generator to excel the SS tasks. To address the issues, we propose new SS tasks based on a multi-class minimax game. The competition between our proposed SS tasks in the game encourages the generator to learn the data distribution and generate diverse samples. We provide both theoretical and empirical analysis to support that our proposed SS tasks have better convergence property. We conduct experiments to incorporate our proposed SS tasks into two different GAN baseline models.

Learning step sizes for unfolded sparse coding,"Pierre Ablin, Thomas Moreau, Mathurin Massias, Alexandre Gramfort","Sparse coding is typically solved by iterative optimization techniques, such as the Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA). Unfolding and learning weights of ISTA using neural networks is a practical way to accelerate estimation. In this paper, we study the selection of adapted step sizes for ISTA. We show that a simple step size strategy can improve the convergence rate of ISTA by leveraging the sparsity of the iterates. However, it is impractical in most large-scale applications. Therefore, we propose a network architecture where only the step sizes of ISTA are learned. We demonstrate that for a large class of unfolded algorithms, if the algorithm converges to the solution of the Lasso, its last layers correspond to ISTA with learned step sizes.

Efficient Graph Generation with Graph Recurrent Attention Networks,"Renjie Liao, Yujia Li, Yang Song, Shenlong Wang, Will Hamilton, David K.

Our model generates graphs one block of nodes and associated edges at a time.
The block size and sampling stride allow us to trade off sample quality for efficiency.
Compared to previous RNN-based graph generative models, our framework better captures the auto-regressive conditioning between the already-generated and to-be-generated parts of the graph using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with attention.
This not only reduces the dependency on node ordering but also bypasses the long-term bottleneck caused by the sequential nature of RNNs.
Moreover, we parameterize the output distribution per block using a mixture of Bernoulli, which captures the correlations among generated edges within the block. 
Finally, we propose to handle node orderings in generation by marginalizing over a family of canonical orderings.
On standard benchmarks, we achieve state-of-the-art time efficiency and sample quality compared to previous models.

This problem is compounded by the presence of social interactions between humans and their physical interactions with the scene. While the existing literature has explored some of these cues, they mainly ignored the multimodal nature of each human's future trajectory which is noticeably influenced by the intricate social interactions. In this paper, we present Social-BiGAT, a graph-based generative adversarial network that generates realistic, multimodal trajectory predictions for multiple pedestrians in a scene. Our method is based on a graph attention network (GAT) that learns feature representations that encode the social interactions between humans in the scene, and a recurrent encoder-decoder architecture that is trained adversarially to predict, based on the features, the humans' paths.

Re-examination of the Role of Latent Variables in Sequence Modeling,"Guokun Lai, Zihang Dai, Yiming Yang, Shinjae Yoo","With latent variables, stochastic recurrent models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in modeling sound-wave sequence.
However, opposite results are also observed in other domains, where standard recurrent networks often outperform stochastic models.
To better understand this discrepancy, we re-examine the roles of latent variables in stochastic recurrent models for speech density estimation.
Our analysis reveals that under the restriction of fully factorized output distribution in previous evaluations, the stochastic variants were implicitly leveraging intra-step correlation but the deterministic recurrent baselines were prohibited to do so, resulting in an unfair comparison.
To correct the unfairness, we remove such restriction in our re-examination, where all the models can explicitly leverage intra-step correlation with an auto-regressive structure.

Consistency-based Semi-supervised Learning for Object detection,"Jisoo Jeong, Seungeui Lee, Jeesoo Kim, Nojun Kwak","Making a precise annotation in a large dataset is crucial to the performance of object detection. While the object detection task requires a huge number of annotated samples to guarantee its performance, placing bounding boxes for every object in each sample is time-consuming and costs a lot. To alleviate this problem, we propose a Consistency-based Semi-supervised learning method for object Detection (CSD), which is a way of using consistency constraints as a tool for enhancing detection performance by making full use of available unlabeled data. Specifically, the consistency constraint is applied not only for object classification but also for the localization.

Comparing Unsupervised Word Translation Methods Step by Step,"Mareike Hartmann, Yova Kementchedjhieva, Anders Søgaard","Cross-lingual word vector space alignment is the task of mapping the vocabularies of two languages into a shared semantic space, which can be used for dictionary induction, unsupervised machine translation, and transfer learning. In the unsupervised regime, an initial seed dictionary is learned in the absence of any known correspondences between words, through {\bf distribution matching}, and the seed dictionary is then used to supervise the induction of the final alignment in what is typically referred to as a (possibly iterative) {\bf refinement} step. We focus on the first step and compare  distribution matching techniques in the context of language pairs for which mixed training stability and evaluation scores have been reported.  We show that, surprisingly, when looking at this initial step in isolation, vanilla GANs are superior to more recent methods, both in terms of precision and robustness.

"Learn, Imagine and Create: Text-to-Image Generation from Prior Knowledge","Tingting Qiao, Jing Zhang, Duanqing Xu, Dacheng Tao","Text-to-image generation, i.e. generating an image given a text description, is a very challenging task due to the significant semantic gap between the two domains. Humans, however, tackle this problem intelligently. We learn from diverse objects to form a solid prior about semantics, textures, colors, shapes, and layouts. Given a text description, we immediately imagine an overall visual impression using this prior and, based on this, we draw a picture by progressively adding more and more details. In this paper, and inspired by this process, we propose a novel text-to-image method called LeicaGAN to combine the above three phases in a unified framework. First, we formulate the multiple priors learning phase as a textual-visual co-embedding (TVE) comprising a text-image encoder for learning semantic, texture, and color priors and a text-mask encoder for learning shape and layout priors. Then, we formulate the imagination phase as multiple priors aggregation (MPA) by combining these complementary priors and adding noise for diversity. Lastly, we formulate the creation phase by using a cascaded attentive generator (CAG) to progressively draw a picture from coarse to fine. We leverage adversarial learning for LeicaGAN to enforce semantic consistency and visual realism. Thorough experiments on two public benchmark datasets demonstrate LeicaGAN's superiority over the baseline method.

Compiler Auto-Vectorization with Imitation Learning,"Charith Mendis, Cambridge Yang, Yewen Pu, Dr.Saman Amarasinghe, Michael Carbin","Modern microprocessors are equipped with single instruction multiple data (SIMD) or vector instruction sets which allow compilers to exploit fine-grained data level parallelism. To exploit this parallelism, compilers employ auto-vectorization techniques to automatically convert scalar code into vector code. Larsen & Amarasinghe (2000) first introduced superword level parallelism (SLP) based vectorization, which is one form of vectorization popularly used by compilers. Current compilers employ hand-crafted heuristics and typically only follow one SLP vectorization strategy which can be suboptimal. Recently, Mendis & Amarasinghe (2018) formulated the instruction packing problem of SLP vectorization by leveraging an integer linear programming (ILP) solver, achieving superior runtime performance. In this work, we explore whether it is feasible to imitate optimal decisions made by their ILP solution by fitting a graph neural network policy. We show that the learnt policy produces a vectorization scheme which is better than industry standard compiler heuristics both in terms of static measures and runtime performance. More specifically, the learnt agent produces a vectorization scheme which has a 22.6% higher average reduction in cost compared to LLVM compiler when measured using its own cost model and achieves a geometric mean runtime speedup of 1.015× on the NAS benchmark suite when compared to LLVM’s SLP vectorizer.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/d1d5923fc822531bbfd9d87d4760914b-Paper.pdf,2019,"vectorization, compilers, slp, instruction, parallelism, runtime, amarasinghe, code, compared, compiler","packing, policy, vectorization, instruction, llvm, goslp, instructions, slp, vector, ii","{'compiler': 0.5373881934884385, 'vectorization': 0.5373881934884385, 'auto': 0.44845770414832664, 'imitation': 0.4389786467472064, 'learning': 0.16914873422071003}","{'vectorization': 0.5397929978965372, 'compilers': 0.30845314165516413, 'slp': 0.30845314165516413, 'instruction': 0.203338606872091, 'parallelism': 0.19776697856723938, 'runtime': 0.16594082487907394, 'amarasinghe': 0.15422657082758207, 'compiler': 0.15422657082758207, 'ilp': 0.15422657082758207, 'llvm': 0.15422657082758207}"

Fast Sparse Group Lasso,"Yasutoshi Ida, Yasuhiro Fujiwara, Hisashi Kashima","Sparse Group Lasso is a method of linear regression analysis that finds sparse parameters in terms of both feature groups and individual features.
Block Coordinate Descent is a standard approach to obtain the parameters of Sparse Group Lasso, and iteratively updates the parameters for each parameter group.

This paper proposes a fast Block Coordinate Descent for Sparse Group Lasso.
It efficiently skips the updates of the groups whose parameters must be zeros by using the parameters in one group.
In addition, it preferentially updates parameters in a candidate group set, which contains groups whose parameters must not be zeros.

In this paper, we consider a modified convex problem requiring  constrained version of the total variation oracles that can be solved with significantly fewer calls to the simple minimization oracles.

Deep Signature Transforms,"Patrick Kidger, Patric Bonnier, Imanol Perez Arribas, Cristopher Salvi, Terry Lyons","The signature is an infinite graded sequence of statistics known to characterise a stream of data up to a negligible equivalence class. It is a transform which has previously been treated as a fixed feature transformation, on top of which a model may be built. We propose a novel approach which combines the advantages of the signature transform with modern deep learning frameworks. By learning an augmentation of the stream prior to the signature transform, the terms of the signature may be selected in a data-dependent way. More generally, we describe how the signature transform may be used as a layer anywhere within a neural network. In this context it may be interpreted as a pooling operation.

ResNets Ensemble via the Feynman-Kac Formalism to Improve Natural and Robust Accuracies,"Bao Wang, Zuoqiang Shi, Stanley Osher","We unify the theory of optimal control of transport equations with the practice of training and testing of ResNets. Based on this unified viewpoint, we propose a simple yet effective ResNets ensemble algorithm to boost the accuracy of the robustly trained model on both clean and adversarial images. The proposed algorithm consists of two components: First, we modify the base ResNets by injecting a variance specified Gaussian noise to the output of each residual mapping. Second, we average over the production of multiple jointly trained modified ResNets to get the final prediction. These two steps give an approximation to the Feynman-Kac formula for representing the solution of a convection-diffusion equation.

Guided Meta-Policy Search,"Russell Mendonca, Abhishek Gupta, Rosen Kralev, Pieter Abbeel, Sergey Levine, Chelsea Finn","Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have demonstrated promising results on complex tasks, yet often require impractical numbers of samples because they learn from scratch. Meta-RL aims to address this challenge by leveraging experience from previous tasks so as to more quickly solve new tasks. However, in practice, these algorithms generally also require large amounts of on-policy experience during the \emph{meta-training} process, making them impractical for use in many problems. To this end, we propose to learn a reinforcement learning procedure in a federated way, where individual off-policy learners can solve the individual meta-training tasks, and then consolidate these solutions into a single meta-learner. Since the central meta-learner learns by imitating the solutions to the individual tasks, it can accommodate either the standard meta-RL problem setting, or a hybrid setting where some or all tasks are provided with example demonstrations. The former results in an approach that can leverage policies learned for previous tasks without significant amounts of on-policy data during meta-training, whereas the latter is particularly useful in cases where demonstrations are easy for a person to provide. Across a number of continuous control meta-RL problems, we demonstrate significant improvements in meta-RL sample efficiency in comparison to prior work as well as the ability to scale to domains with visual observations.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/d324a0cc02881779dcda44a675fdcaaa-Paper.pdf,2019,"meta, tasks, rl, individual, policy, training, algorithms, amounts, demonstrations, experience","meta, learning, policy, tasks, training, task, rl, reinforcement, algorithm, demonstrations","{'guided': 0.5851445828702598, 'meta': 0.477326687369556, 'search': 0.470044321362785, 'policy': 0.45697197574577214}","{'meta': 0.5608740794425258, 'rl': 0.3115967108014032, 'tasks': 0.24899451537418654, 'individual': 0.18144175578380145, 'demonstrations': 0.16416154886467968, 'amounts': 0.16153666422569127, 'impractical': 0.15489495418228233, 'policy': 0.15070994590089115, 'experience': 0.13212785949640815, 'learner': 0.1296599008870123}"

Cross-Modal Learning with Adversarial Samples,"CHAO LI, Shangqian Gao, Cheng Deng, De Xie, Wei Liu","With the rapid developments of deep neural networks, numerous deep cross-modal analysis methods have been presented and are being applied in widespread real-world applications, including healthcare and safety-critical environments. However, the recent studies on robustness and stability of deep neural networks show that a microscopic modification, known as adversarial sample, which is even imperceptible to humans, can easily fool a well-performed deep neural network and brings a new obstacle to deep cross-modal correlation exploring. In this paper, we propose a novel Cross-Modal correlation Learning with Adversarial samples, namely CMLA, which for the first time presents the existence of adversarial samples in cross-modal data. Moreover, we provide a simple yet effective adversarial sample learning method, where inter- and intra- modality similarity regularizations across different modalities are simultaneously integrated into the learning of adversarial samples. Finally, our proposed CMLA is demonstrated to be highly effective in cross-modal hashing based retrieval. Extensive experiments on two cross-modal benchmark datasets show that the adversarial examples produced by our CMLA are efficient in fooling a target deep cross-modal hashing network. On the other hand, such adversarial examples can significantly strengthen the robustness of the target network by conducting an adversarial training.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/d384dec9f5f7a64a36b5c8f03b8a6d92-Paper.pdf,2019,"adversarial, cross, modal, deep, cmla, learning, network, neural, samples, correlation","modal, cross, adversarial, ssah, dcmh, retrieval, samples, text, learning, deep","{'modal': 0.5434574148287394, 'samples': 0.5434574148287394, 'cross': 0.49255647590704627, 'adversarial': 0.3558889844980723, 'learning': 0.20009803919651276}","{'modal': 0.49691706555346465, 'cross': 0.3946520912744204, 'adversarial': 0.3317564686980648, 'cmla': 0.282918955207534, 'deep': 0.1946261645746317, 'hashing': 0.15113824221429667, 'samples': 0.12605774350982415, 'correlation': 0.12470640130626513, 'robustness': 0.1003889142604955, 'examples': 0.09548783722653821}"
Learning Disentangled Representation for Robust Person Re-identification,"Chanho Eom, Bumsub Ham","We address the problem of person re-identification (reID), that is, retrieving person images from a large dataset, given a query image of the person of interest. The key challenge is to learn person representations robust to intra-class variations, as different persons can have the same attribute and the same person's appearance looks different with viewpoint changes. Recent reID methods focus on learning discriminative features but robust to only a particular factor of variations (e.g., human pose) and this requires corresponding supervisory signals (e.g., pose annotations). To tackle this problem, we propose to disentangle identity-related and -unrelated features from person images. Identity-related features contain information useful for specifying a particular person (e.g.,clothing), while identity-unrelated ones hold other factors (e.g., human pose, scale changes). To this end, we introduce a new generative adversarial network, dubbed identity shuffle GAN (IS-GAN), that factorizes these features using identification labels without any auxiliary information. We also propose an identity shuffling technique to regularize the disentangled features. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of IS-GAN, largely outperforming the state of the art on standard reID benchmarks including the Market-1501, CUHK03 and DukeMTMC-reID.

On Testing for Biases in Peer Review,"Ivan Stelmakh, Nihar Shah, Aarti Singh","We consider the issue of biases in scholarly research, specifically, in peer review. There is a long standing debate on whether exposing author identities to reviewers induces biases against certain groups, and our focus is on designing tests to detect the presence of such biases. Our starting point is a remarkable recent work by Tomkins, Zhang and Heavlin which conducted a controlled, large-scale experiment to investigate existence of biases in the peer reviewing of the WSDM conference. We present two sets of results in this paper. The first set of results is negative, and pertains to the statistical tests and the experimental setup used in the work of Tomkins et al. We show that the test employed therein does not guarantee control over false alarm probability and under correlations between relevant variables, coupled with any of the following conditions, with high probability can declare a presence of bias when it is in fact absent: (a) measurement error, (b) model mismatch, (c) reviewer calibration. Moreover, we show that the setup of their experiment may itself inflate false alarm probability if (d) bidding is performed in non-blind manner or (e) popular reviewer assignment procedure is employed.  Our second set of results is positive, in that we present a general framework for testing for biases in (single vs. double blind) peer review. We then present a hypothesis test with guaranteed control over false alarm probability and non-trivial power even under conditions (a)--(c). Conditions (d) and (e) are more fundamental problems that are tied to the experimental setup and not necessarily related to the test.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/d3d80b656929a5bc0fa34381bf42fbdd-Paper.pdf,2019,"biases, probability, alarm, conditions, false, peer, present, results, setup, test","test, sb, reviewers, db, paper, error, reviewer, bias, tomkins, al","{'peer': 0.5411592716891909, 'review': 0.5411592716891909, 'biases': 0.47565765013005157, 'testing': 0.43363934923206204}","{'biases': 0.31034915420389203, 'alarm': 0.2837729012210298, 'peer': 0.24942518483339576, 'false': 0.2035512171228025, 'setup': 0.1993818564200194, 'tomkins': 0.1891819341473532, 'probability': 0.18087749720712912, 'review': 0.17904919639362366, 'reviewer': 0.17904919639362366, 'conditions': 0.148925459261505}"

Using accepted hiring models and the concept of structured interviews, a best practice in human resources, we cast tiered hiring as a combinatorial pure exploration (CPE) problem in the stochastic multi-armed bandit setting.

Manifold-regression to predict from MEG/EEG brain signals without source modeling,"David Sabbagh, Pierre Ablin, Gael Varoquaux, Alexandre Gramfort, Denis A. Engemann","Magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography (M/EEG) can reveal neuronal dynamics non-invasively in real-time and are therefore appreciated methods in medicine and neuroscience. Recent advances in modeling brain-behavior relationships have highlighted the effectiveness of Riemannian geometry for summarizing the spatially correlated time-series from M/EEG in terms of their covariance. However, after artefact-suppression, M/EEG data is often rank deficient which limits the application of Riemannian concepts. In this article, we focus on the task of regression with rank-reduced covariance matrices. We study two Riemannian approaches that vectorize the M/EEG covariance between sensors through projection into a tangent space. The Wasserstein distance readily applies to rank-reduced data but lacks affine-invariance. This can be overcome by finding a common subspace in which the covariance matrices are full rank, enabling the affine-invariant geometric distance. We investigated the implications of these two approaches in synthetic generative models, which allowed us to control estimation bias of a linear model for prediction. We show that Wasserstein and geometric distances allow perfect out-of-sample prediction on the generative models.

Reflection Separation using a Pair of Unpolarized and Polarized Images,"Youwei Lyu, Zhaopeng Cui, Si Li, Marc Pollefeys, Boxin Shi","When we take photos through glass windows or doors, the transmitted background scene is often blended with undesirable reflection. Separating two layers apart to enhance the image quality is of vital importance for both human and machine perception. In this paper, we propose to exploit physical constraints from a pair of unpolarized and polarized images to separate reflection and transmission layers. Due to the simplified capturing setup, the system becomes more underdetermined compared with existing polarization based solutions that take three or more images as input. We propose to solve semireflector orientation estimation first to make the physical image formation well-posed and then learn to reliably separate two layers using a refinement network with gradient loss.

Co-Generation with GANs using AIS based HMC,"Tiantian Fang, Alexander Schwing","Inferring the most likely configuration for a subset of variables of a joint distribution given the remaining ones -- which we refer to as co-generation -- is an important challenge that is computationally demanding for all but the simplest settings.

In contrast, almost nothing is known about this task when considering recently proposed techniques for modeling high-dimensional distributions, particularly generative adversarial nets (GANs).

Sim2real transfer learning for 3D human pose estimation: motion to the rescue,"Carl Doersch, Andrew Zisserman","Synthetic visual data can provide practicically infinite diversity and rich labels,
while avoiding ethical issues with privacy and bias. However, for many tasks,
current models trained on synthetic data generalize poorly to real data. The task of
3D human pose estimation is a particularly interesting example of this sim2real
problem, because learning-based approaches perform reasonably well given real
training data, yet labeled 3D poses are extremely difficult to obtain in the wild,
limiting scalability. In this paper, we show that standard neural-network approaches,
which perform poorly when trained on synthetic RGB images, can perform well
when the data is pre-processed to extract cues about the person’s motion, notably
as optical flow and the motion of 2D keypoints. Therefore, our results suggest
that motion can be a simple way to bridge a sim2real gap when video is available.
We evaluate on the 3D Poses in the Wild dataset, the most challenging modern

These bounds tend to depend on the dimension of the model $d$ in that the number of bits needed to achieve a particular error bound increases as $d$ increases.
In this paper, we derive new bounds for low-precision training algorithms that do not contain the dimension $d$ , which lets us better understand what affects the convergence of these algorithms as parameters scale.

Assessing Disparate Impact of Personalized Interventions: Identifiability and Bounds,"Nathan Kallus, Angela Zhou","Personalized interventions in social services, education, and healthcare leverage individual-level causal effect predictions in order to give the best treatment to each individual or to prioritize program interventions for the individuals most likely to benefit. While the sensitivity of these domains compels us to evaluate the fairness of such policies, we show that actually auditing their disparate impacts per standard observational metrics, such as true positive rates, is impossible since ground truths are unknown. Whether our data is experimental or observational, an individual's actual outcome under an intervention different than that received can never be known, only predicted based on features. We prove how we can nonetheless point-identify these quantities under the additional assumption of monotone treatment response, which may be reasonable in many applications. We further provide a sensitivity analysis for this assumption via sharp partial-identification bounds under violations of monotonicity of varying strengths.

Cascade RPN: Delving into High-Quality Region Proposal Network with Adaptive Convolution,"Thang Vu, Hyunjun Jang, Trung X. Pham, Chang Yoo","This paper considers an architecture referred to as Cascade Region Proposal Network (Cascade RPN) for improving the region-proposal quality and detection performance by systematically addressing the limitation of the conventional RPN that heuristically defines the anchors and aligns the features to the anchors. First, instead of using multiple anchors with predefined scales and aspect ratios, Cascade RPN relies on a single anchor per location and performs multi-stage refinement. Each stage is progressively more stringent in defining positive samples by starting out with an anchor-free metric followed by anchor-based metrics in the ensuing stages. Second, to attain alignment between the features and the anchors throughout the stages, adaptive convolution is proposed that takes the anchors in addition to the image features as its input and learns the sampled features guided by the anchors. A simple implementation of a two-stage Cascade RPN achieves 13.4 point AR higher than that of the conventional RPN, surpassing any existing region proposal methods. When adopting to Fast R-CNN and Faster R-CNN, Cascade RPN can improve the detection mAP by 3.1 and 3.5 points, respectively.

Flexible Modeling of Diversity with Strongly Log-Concave Distributions,"Joshua Robinson, Suvrit Sra, Stefanie Jegelka","Strongly log-concave (SLC) distributions are a rich class of discrete probability distributions over subsets of some ground set.

We propose SLC as the right extension of SR that enables easier, more intuitive control over diversity, illustrating this via examples of practical importance. We develop two fundamental tools needed to apply SLC distributions to learning and inference: sampling and mode finding.

Unsupervised Curricula for Visual Meta-Reinforcement Learning,"Allan Jabri, Kyle Hsu, Abhishek Gupta, Ben Eysenbach, Sergey Levine, Chelsea Finn","In principle, meta-reinforcement learning algorithms leverage experience across many tasks to learn fast and effective reinforcement learning (RL) strategies. However, current meta-RL approaches rely on manually-defined distributions of training tasks, and hand-crafting these task distributions can be challenging and time-consuming. Can ``useful'' pre-training tasks be discovered in an unsupervised manner? We develop an unsupervised algorithm for inducing an adaptive meta-training task distribution, i.e. an automatic curriculum, by modeling unsupervised interaction in a visual environment. 
The task distribution is scaffolded by a parametric density model of the meta-learner's trajectory distribution. 
We formulate unsupervised meta-RL as information maximization between a latent task variable and the meta-learner’s data distribution, and describe a practical instantiation which alternates between integration of recent experience into the task distribution and meta-learning of the updated tasks. Repeating this procedure leads to iterative reorganization such that the curriculum adapts as the meta-learner's data distribution shifts. Moreover, we show how discriminative clustering frameworks for visual representations can support  trajectory-level task acquisition and exploration in domains with pixel observations, avoiding the pitfalls of alternatives.
In experiments on vision-based navigation and manipulation domains, we show that the algorithm allows for unsupervised meta-learning that both transfers to downstream tasks specified by hand-crafted reward functions and serves as pre-training for more efficient meta-learning of test task distributions.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/d5a28f81834b6df2b6db6d3e5e2635c7-Paper.pdf,2019,"meta, task, distribution, learning, tasks, unsupervised, training, distributions, learner, rl","meta, task, learning, tasks, distribution, rl, qφ, unsupervised, policy, carml","{'curricula': 0.597409905577647, 'visual': 0.42401332785739887, 'unsupervised': 0.40466919900334103, 'meta': 0.3980890406599606, 'reinforcement': 0.32515005567649796, 'learning': 0.18804121594745624}","{'meta': 0.5537385013972266, 'unsupervised': 0.2603718669501171, 'task': 0.25352230456744435, 'distribution': 0.2144395641619291, 'learner': 0.17281395322778495, 'rl': 0.16612155041916796, 'curriculum': 0.15836618553832785, 'tasks': 0.15803147949615856, 'distributions': 0.12914837747126803, 'trajectory': 0.11981113971258368}"
Improved Regret Bounds for Bandit Combinatorial Optimization,"Shinji Ito, Daisuke Hatano, Hanna Sumita, Kei Takemura, Takuro Fukunaga, Naonori Kakimura, Ken-Ichi Kawarabayashi","\textit{Bandit combinatorial optimization} is a bandit framework in which a player chooses an action within a given finite set $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \{ 0, 1 \}^d$ and incurs a loss that is the inner product of the chosen action and an unobservable loss vector in $\mathbb{R} ^ d$ in each round. In this paper, we aim to reveal the property, which makes the bandit combinatorial optimization hard. Recently, Cohen et al.~\citep{cohen2017tight} obtained a lower bound $\Omega(\sqrt{d k^3 T / \log T})$ of the regret, where $k$ is the maximum $\ell_1$-norm of action vectors, and $T$ is the number of rounds. This lower bound was achieved by considering a continuous strongly-correlated distribution of losses. Our main contribution is that we managed to improve this bound by $\Omega( \sqrt{d k ^3 T} )$ through applying a factor of $\sqrt{\log T}$, which can be done by means of strongly-correlated losses with \textit{binary} values. The bound derives better regret bounds for three specific examples of the bandit combinatorial optimization: the multitask bandit, the bandit ranking and the multiple-play bandit. In particular, the bound obtained for the bandit ranking in the present study addresses an open problem raised in \citep{cohen2017tight}. In addition, we demonstrate that the problem becomes easier without considering correlations among entries of loss vectors. In fact, if each entry of loss vectors is an independent random variable, then, one can achieve a regret of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d k^2 T})$, which is $\sqrt{k}$ times smaller than the lower bound shown above. The observed results indicated that correlation among losses is the reason for observing a large regret.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/d5b3d8dadd770c460b1cde910a711987-Paper.pdf,2019,"bandit, bound, sqrt, loss, regret, action, combinatorial, losses, lower, optimization","bandit, bound, lower, regret, log, problem, bounds, distribution, loss, rt","{'combinatorial': 0.4687813408592517, 'improved': 0.45186552157096543, 'bandit': 0.43804429084786556, 'regret': 0.39209501892417037, 'bounds': 0.3738132727196314, 'optimization': 0.3011709438287249}","{'bandit': 0.43256973837818663, 'sqrt': 0.2678031740816798, 'bound': 0.24524574696289797, 'losses': 0.19550443905804651, 'regret': 0.19145889829336785, 'combinatorial': 0.1901157909479684, 'cohen2017tight': 0.18550287663828235, 'vectors': 0.17521226427130826, 'loss': 0.1607353733840962, 'action': 0.15993932122439392}"
Doubly-Robust Lasso Bandit,"Gi-Soo Kim, Myunghee Cho Paik","Contextual multi-armed bandit algorithms are widely used in sequential decision tasks such as news article recommendation systems, web page ad placement algorithms, and mobile health. Most of the existing algorithms have regret proportional to a polynomial function of the context dimension, $d$. In many applications however, it is often the case that contexts are high-dimensional with only a sparse subset of size $s_0 (\ll d)$ being correlated with the reward. We consider the stochastic linear contextual bandit problem and propose a novel algorithm, namely the Doubly-Robust Lasso Bandit algorithm, which exploits the sparse structure of the regression parameter as in Lasso, while blending the doubly-robust technique used in missing data literature. The high-probability upper bound of the regret incurred by the proposed algorithm does not depend on the number of arms and scales with $\mathrm{log}(d)$ instead of a polynomial function of $d$. The proposed algorithm shows good performance when contexts of different arms are correlated and requires less tuning parameters than existing methods.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/d60678e8f2ba9c540798ebbde31177e8-Paper.pdf,2019,"algorithm, algorithms, bandit, arms, contexts, contextual, correlated, doubly, existing, function","bandit, lasso, arms, arm, algorithm, bi, probability, regret, zt, context","{'doubly': 0.6009373290337244, 'lasso': 0.5459138182023799, 'bandit': 0.45870361687667455, 'robust': 0.3611695191094745}","{'doubly': 0.25528724647199885, 'bandit': 0.25397822843983525, 'lasso': 0.2286935411685487, 'arms': 0.20833513572422024, 'contexts': 0.20209983586509855, 'contextual': 0.19844310767630685, 'correlated': 0.19058584097964137, 'algorithm': 0.17094995046674089, 'polynomial': 0.16694486967731278, 'regret': 0.14988378364116056}"
Recurrent Kernel Networks,"Dexiong Chen, Laurent Jacob, Julien Mairal","Substring kernels are classical tools for representing biological sequences or text.

In this paper, we revisit this link by generalizing convolutional kernel networks---originally related to a relaxation of the mismatch kernel---to model gaps in sequences.

"Ask not what AI can do, but what AI should do: Towards a framework of task delegability","Brian Lubars, Chenhao Tan","While artificial intelligence (AI) holds promise for addressing societal challenges, issues of exactly which tasks to automate and to what extent to do so remain understudied. We approach this problem of task delegability from a human-centered perspective by developing a framework on human perception of task delegation to AI. We consider four high-level factors that can contribute to a delegation decision: motivation, difficulty, risk, and trust. To obtain an empirical understanding of human preferences in different tasks, we build a dataset of 100 tasks from academic papers, popular media portrayal of AI, and everyday life, and administer a survey based on our proposed framework. We find little preference for full AI control and a strong preference for machine-in-the-loop designs, in which humans play the leading role. Among the four factors, trust is the most correlated with human preferences of optimal human-machine delegation. This framework represents a first step towards characterizing human preferences of AI automation across tasks. We hope this work encourages future efforts towards understanding such individual attitudes; our goal is to inform the public and the AI research community rather than dictating any direction in technology development.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/d67d8ab4f4c10bf22aa353e27879133c-Paper.pdf,2019,"ai, human, tasks, delegation, framework, preferences, factors, four, machine, preference","task, trust, ai, tasks, human, machine, survey, motivation, delegability, risk","{'ai': 0.6974749908550201, 'ask': 0.38388729511592523, 'delegability': 0.38388729511592523, 'task': 0.27843789605067976, 'towards': 0.27536359470055066, 'framework': 0.25580647995195194}","{'ai': 0.4614261491117761, 'human': 0.30699513845882664, 'delegation': 0.3022520287518231, 'preferences': 0.2218036999602773, 'trust': 0.16815559965855834, 'preference': 0.1561247649325002, 'tasks': 0.1375157429203582, 'four': 0.13535868619904487, 'factors': 0.11582206568754565, 'towards': 0.11477809788197359}"

Bias Correction of Learned Generative Models using Likelihood-Free Importance Weighting,"Aditya Grover, Jiaming Song, Ashish Kapoor, Kenneth Tran, Alekh Agarwal, Eric J.

A standard technique to correct this bias is importance sampling, where samples from the model are weighted  by the likelihood ratio under model and true distributions. When the likelihood ratio is unknown, it can be estimated by training a probabilistic classifier to distinguish samples from the two distributions. We employ this likelihood-free importance weighting method to correct for the bias in generative models. We find that this technique consistently improves standard goodness-of-fit metrics for evaluating the sample quality of state-of-the-art deep generative models, suggesting reduced bias.

LCA: Loss Change Allocation for Neural Network Training,"Janice Lan, Rosanne Liu, Hattie Zhou, Jason Yosinski","Neural networks enjoy widespread use, but many aspects of their training, representation, and operation are poorly understood. In particular, our view into the training process is limited, with a single scalar loss being the most common viewport into this high-dimensional, dynamic process. We propose a new window into training called Loss Change Allocation (LCA), in which credit for changes to the network loss is conservatively partitioned to the parameters. This measurement is accomplished by decomposing the components of an approximate path integral along the training trajectory using a Runge-Kutta integrator. This rich view shows which parameters are responsible for decreasing or increasing the loss during training, or which parameters ""help"" or ""hurt"" the network's learning, respectively. LCA may be summed over training iterations and/or over neurons, channels, or layers for increasingly coarse views. This new measurement device produces several insights into training. (1) We find that barely over 50% of parameters help during any given iteration. (2) Some entire layers hurt overall, moving on average against the training gradient, a phenomenon we hypothesize may be due to phase lag in an oscillatory training process.

In this paper, we propose to leverage cross-modal information to enhance metric-based few-shot learning methods.
Visual and semantic feature spaces have different structures by definition. For certain concepts, visual features might be richer and more discriminative than text ones. While for others, the inverse might be true. Moreover, when the support from visual information is limited in image classification, semantic representations (learned from unsupervised text corpora) can provide strong prior knowledge and context to help learning. Based on these two intuitions, we propose a mechanism that can adaptively combine information from both modalities according to new image categories to be learned. Through a series of experiments, we show that by this adaptive combination of the two modalities, our model outperforms current uni-modality few-shot learning methods and modality-alignment methods by a large margin on all benchmarks and few-shot scenarios tested.

Polynomial Cost of Adaptation for X-Armed Bandits,Hedi Hadiji,"In the context of stochastic continuum-armed bandits, we present an algorithm that adapts to the unknown smoothness of the objective function. We exhibit and compute a polynomial cost of adaptation to the Hölder regularity for regret minimization.

Modelling heterogeneous distributions with an Uncountable Mixture of Asymmetric Laplacians,"Axel Brando, Jose A. Rodriguez, Jordi Vitria, Alberto Rubio Muñoz","In regression tasks, aleatoric uncertainty is commonly addressed by considering a parametric distribution of the output variable, which is based on strong assumptions such as symmetry, unimodality or by supposing a restricted shape. These assumptions are too limited in scenarios where complex shapes, strong skews or multiple modes are present. In this paper, we propose a generic deep learning framework that learns an Uncountable Mixture of Asymmetric Laplacians (UMAL), which will allow us to estimate heterogeneous distributions of the output variable and shows its connections to quantile regression. Despite having a fixed number of parameters, the model can be interpreted as an infinite mixture of components, which yields a flexible approximation for heterogeneous distributions. Apart from synthetic cases, we apply this model to room price forecasting and to predict financial operations in personal bank accounts. We demonstrate that UMAL produces proper distributions, which allows us to extract richer insights and to sharpen decision-making.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/d80126524c1e9641333502c664fc6ca1-Paper.pdf,2019,"distributions, assumptions, heterogeneous, mixture, model, output, regression, strong, umal, us","distribution, model, umal, mixture, data, function, distributions, mdn, regression, 10","{'laplacians': 0.41863813556426194, 'uncountable': 0.41863813556426194, 'mixture': 0.3803064512542308, 'modelling': 0.3803064512542308, 'asymmetric': 0.3679664051504787, 'heterogeneous': 0.3578838533433811, 'distributions': 0.31102749294573784}","{'umal': 0.2916740941507099, 'heterogeneous': 0.2049333185486224, 'distributions': 0.20334227260392584, 'mixture': 0.1943594494194869, 'variable': 0.16922579388141648, 'assumptions': 0.1581415949753798, 'output': 0.14631212457655218, 'laplacians': 0.14583704707535494, 'sharpen': 0.14583704707535494, 'skews': 0.14583704707535494}"
GNNExplainer: Generating Explanations for Graph Neural Networks,"Zhitao Ying, Dylan Bourgeois, Jiaxuan You, Marinka Zitnik, Jure Leskovec","Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a powerful tool for machine learning on graphs.GNNs combine node feature information with the graph structure by 
recursively passing neural messages along edges of the input graph. However, incorporating both graph structure and feature information leads to complex models,

we propose GNNExplainer, the first general, model-agnostic approach for providing interpretable explanations for predictions of any GNN-based model on any graph-based machine learning task. Given an instance, GNNExplainer identifies a compact subgraph structure and a small subset of node features that have a crucial role in GNN's prediction. 
Further, GNNExplainer  can generate consistent and concise explanations for an entire class of instances.
We formulate GNNExplainer as an optimization task that maximizes the mutual information between a GNN's prediction and distribution of possible subgraph structures.

Missing Not at Random in Matrix Completion: The Effectiveness of Estimating Missingness Probabilities Under a Low Nuclear Norm Assumption,"Wei Ma, George H. Chen","Matrix completion is often applied to data with entries missing not at random (MNAR). For example, consider a recommendation system where users tend to only reveal ratings for items they like. In this case, a matrix completion method that relies on entries being revealed at uniformly sampled row and column indices can yield overly optimistic predictions of unseen user ratings. Recently, various papers have shown that we can reduce this bias in MNAR matrix completion if we know the probabilities of different matrix entries being missing. These probabilities are typically modeled using logistic regression or naive Bayes, which make strong assumptions and lack guarantees on the accuracy of the estimated probabilities. In this paper, we suggest a simple approach to estimating these probabilities that avoids these shortcomings. Our approach follows from the observation that missingness patterns in real data often exhibit low nuclear norm structure. We can then estimate the missingness probabilities by feeding the (always fully-observed) binary matrix specifying which entries are revealed to an existing nuclear-norm-constrained matrix completion algorithm by Davenport et al. [2014]. Thus, we tackle MNAR matrix completion by solving a different matrix completion problem first that recovers missingness probabilities. We establish finite-sample error bounds for how accurate these probability estimates are and how well these estimates debias standard matrix completion losses for the original matrix to be completed. Our experiments show that the proposed debiasing strategy can improve a variety of existing matrix completion algorithms, and achieves downstream matrix completion accuracy at least as good as logistic regression and naive Bayes debiasing baselines that require additional auxiliary information.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/d828725179d622a56f951e527a966ed7-Paper.pdf,2019,"matrix, completion, probabilities, entries, missingness, mnar, accuracy, approach, bayes, data","matrix, mse, 1bitmc, completion, entries, propensity, al, et, 002, svd","{'assumption': 0.32311336236307225, 'effectiveness': 0.32311336236307225, 'missing': 0.32311336236307225, 'missingness': 0.32311336236307225, 'nuclear': 0.32311336236307225, 'probabilities': 0.3058071487422691, 'completion': 0.2840038981268897, 'estimating': 0.2762219811469659, 'norm': 0.26964246408980175, 'matrix': 0.2400572964944985}","{'completion': 0.5016810310451523, 'matrix': 0.42669421258065215, 'probabilities': 0.3096316681379604, 'entries': 0.2196616858770784, 'mnar': 0.21583038907698374, 'missingness': 0.20427033847458803, 'debiasing': 0.13618022564972537, 'ratings': 0.13618022564972537, 'nuclear': 0.12007558278320157, 'revealed': 0.11753754334013633}"

Scalable Structure Learning of Continuous-Time Bayesian Networks from Incomplete Data,"Dominik Linzner, Michael Schmidt, Heinz Koeppl","Continuous-time Bayesian Networks (CTBNs) represent a compact yet powerful framework for understanding multivariate time-series data. Given complete data, parameters and structure can be estimated efficiently in closed-form. However, if data is incomplete, the latent states of the CTBN have to be estimated by laboriously simulating the intractable dynamics of the assumed CTBN. This is a problem, especially for structure learning tasks, where this has to be done for each element of a super-exponentially growing set of possible structures. In order to circumvent this notorious bottleneck, we develop a novel gradient-based approach to structure learning. Instead of sampling and scoring all possible structures individually, we assume the generator of the CTBN to be composed as a mixture of generators stemming from different structures. In this framework, structure learning can be performed via a gradient-based optimization of mixture weights. We combine this approach with a new variational method that allows for a closed-form calculation of this mixture marginal likelihood.

Cross-channel Communication Networks,"Jianwei Yang, Zhile Ren, Chuang Gan, Hongyuan Zhu, Devi Parikh","Convolutional neural networks process input data by sending channel-wise feature response maps to subsequent layers. While a lot of progress has been made by making networks deeper, information from each channel can only be propagated from lower levels to higher levels in a hierarchical feed-forward manner. When viewing each filter in the convolutional layer as a neuron, those neurons are not communicating explicitly within each layer in CNNs. We introduce a novel network unit called Cross-channel Communication (C3) block, a simple yet effective module to encourage the neuron communication within the same layer. The C3 block enables neurons to exchange information through a micro neural network, which consists of a feature encoder, a message communicator, and a feature decoder, before sending the information to the next layer. With C3 block, each neuron accounts for the channel-wise responses from other neurons at the same layer and learns more discriminative and complementary representations.

Differentiable Ranking and Sorting using Optimal Transport,"Marco Cuturi, Olivier Teboul, Jean-Philippe Vert","Sorting is used pervasively in machine learning, either to define elementary algorithms, such as $k$-nearest neighbors ($k$-NN) rules, or to define test-time metrics, such as top-$k$ classification accuracy or ranking losses. Sorting is however a poor match for the end-to-end, automatically differentiable pipelines of deep learning. Indeed, sorting procedures output two vectors, neither of which is differentiable: the vector of sorted values is piecewise linear, while the sorting permutation itself (or its inverse, the vector of ranks) has no differentiable properties to speak of, since it is integer-valued. We propose in this paper to replace the usual \texttt{sort} procedure with a differentiable proxy. Our proxy builds upon the fact that sorting can be seen as an optimal assignment problem, one in which the $n$ values to be sorted are matched to an \emph{auxiliary} probability measure supported on any \emph{increasing} family of $n$ target values. From this observation, we propose extended rank and sort operators by considering optimal transport (OT) problems (the natural relaxation for assignments) where the auxiliary measure can be any weighted measure supported on $m$ increasing values, where $m \ne n$. We recover differentiable operators by regularizing these OT problems with an entropic penalty, and solve them by applying Sinkhorn iterations.

Ordered Memory,"Yikang Shen, Shawn Tan, Arian Hosseini, Zhouhan Lin, Alessandro Sordoni, Aaron C.

However, the difficulty of training memory models remains a problem obstructing the widespread use of such models. In this paper, we propose the Ordered Memory architecture.

Approximating the Permanent by Sampling from Adaptive Partitions,"Jonathan Kuck, Tri Dao, Hamid Rezatofighi, Ashish Sabharwal, Stefano Ermon","Computing the permanent of a non-negative matrix is a core problem with practical applications ranging from target tracking to statistical thermodynamics. However, this problem is also #P-complete, which leaves little hope for finding an exact solution that can be computed efficiently.  While the problem admits a fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme, this method has seen little use because it is both inefficient in practice and difficult to implement.  We present ADAPART, a simple and efficient method for exact sampling of permutations, each associated with a weight as determined by a matrix.  ADAPART uses an adaptive, iterative partitioning strategy over permutations to convert any upper bounding method for the permanent into one that satisfies a desirable `nesting' property over the partition used. These samples are then used to construct tight bounds on the permanent which hold with a high probability. Empirically, ADAPART provides significant speedups (sometimes exceeding 50x) over prior work. We also empirically observe polynomial scaling in some cases.  In the context of multi-target tracking, ADAPART allows us to use the optimal proposal distribution during particle filtering, leading to orders of magnitude fewer samples and improved tracking performance.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/d914a6c6d93c8df063b9099a076a488c-Paper.pdf,2019,"adapart, method, permanent, problem, tracking, also, empirically, exact, little, matrix","partition, permanent, adapart, bounds, upper, bound, function, matrix, sampling, partitioning","{'partitions': 0.5249198875418059, 'permanent': 0.5249198875418059, 'approximating': 0.4768567473068883, 'sampling': 0.3444482029589838, 'adaptive': 0.32075115175540225}","{'adapart': 0.4637266604627043, 'permanent': 0.34779499534702824, 'tracking': 0.2694741807895669, 'permutations': 0.210633272043936, 'little': 0.15103296369592398, 'polynomial': 0.13327399310844215, 'exact': 0.12668545428995645, 'target': 0.11595927929746286, 'thermodynamics': 0.11593166511567607, 'matrix': 0.11459778850246367}"
Reverse engineering recurrent networks for sentiment classification reveals line attractor dynamics,"Niru Maheswaranathan, Alex Williams, Matthew Golub, Surya Ganguli, David Sussillo","Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a widely used tool for modeling sequential data, yet they are often treated as inscrutable black boxes. Given a trained recurrent network, we would like to reverse engineer it--to obtain a quantitative, interpretable description of how it solves a particular task. Even for simple tasks, a detailed understanding of how recurrent networks work, or a prescription for how to develop such an understanding, remains elusive. In this work, we use tools from dynamical systems analysis to reverse engineer recurrent networks trained to perform sentiment classification, a foundational natural language processing task. Given a trained network, we find fixed points of the recurrent dynamics and linearize the nonlinear system around these fixed points. Despite their theoretical capacity to implement complex, high-dimensional computations, we find that trained networks converge to highly interpretable, low-dimensional representations. In particular, the topological structure of the fixed points and corresponding linearized dynamics reveal an approximate line attractor within the RNN, which we can use to quantitatively understand how the RNN solves the sentiment analysis task. Finally, we find this mechanism present across RNN architectures (including LSTMs, GRUs, and vanilla RNNs) trained on multiple datasets, suggesting that our findings are not unique to a particular architecture or dataset. Overall, these results demonstrate that surprisingly universal and human interpretable computations can arise across a range of recurrent networks.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/d921c3c762b1522c475ac8fc0811bb0f-Paper.pdf,2019,"recurrent, networks, trained, find, fixed, interpretable, particular, points, rnn, task","ﬁxed, points, rnn, state, words, fig, dynamics, input, point, line","{'engineering': 0.3738297122302267, 'sentiment': 0.3738297122302267, 'attractor': 0.35380708979720576, 'line': 0.35380708979720576, 'reveals': 0.35380708979720576, 'reverse': 0.35380708979720576, 'dynamics': 0.2626567289854406, 'recurrent': 0.2554171763028211, 'classification': 0.24530404666773176, 'networks': 0.15932450784878457}","{'recurrent': 0.35893881849790676, 'rnn': 0.23325271635834702, 'trained': 0.22266888028631932, 'engineer': 0.21190240662895451, 'interpretable': 0.20557259045300197, 'reverse': 0.18115036203018153, 'sentiment': 0.16980069735193085, 'fixed': 0.16739033638554593, 'solves': 0.16685147558381536, 'networks': 0.1631276408774268}"

Relations are modelled as rotations in the quaternion space. The advantages of the proposed approach are: (1) Latent inter-dependencies (between all components) are aptly captured with Hamilton product, encouraging a more compact interaction between entities and relations; (2) Quaternions enable expressive rotation in four-dimensional space and have more degree of freedom than rotation in complex plane; (3) The proposed framework is a generalization of ComplEx on hypercomplex space while offering better geometrical interpretations, concurrently satisfying the key desiderata of relational representation learning (i.e., modeling symmetry, anti-symmetry and inversion).

In order to be able to control all the factors of variation precisely, we built an experimental platform where the objects are being moved by a robotic arm.

Subquadratic High-Dimensional Hierarchical Clustering,"Amir Abboud, Vincent Cohen-Addad, Hussein Houdrouge","We consider the widely-used average-linkage, single-linkage, and Ward's methods for
  computing hierarchical clusterings of high-dimensional Euclidean inputs.
  It is easy to show that there is no efficient implementation of these algorithms
  in high dimensional Euclidean space since it implicitly requires to solve the closest
  pair problem, a notoriously difficult problem.

  However, how fast can these algorithms be implemented if we allow approximation?
  More precisely: these algorithms successively merge the clusters that are at closest
  average (for average-linkage), minimum distance (for single-linkage), or inducing the least  sum-of-square error (for Ward's). We ask whether one could obtain a significant running-time improvement if the algorithm can merge   $\gamma$-approximate closest clusters (namely, clusters that are at distance   (average, minimum, or sum-of-square error) at most  $\gamma$ times the distance of the closest clusters). 

  We show that one can indeed take advantage of the relaxation and compute the approximate  hierarchical clustering tree using $\widetilde{O}(n)$ $\gamma$-approximate nearest neighbor  queries.
  This leads to an algorithm running in time  $\widetilde{O}(nd) + n^{1+O(1/\gamma)}$ for $d$-dimensional Euclidean space.

In this paper, we study five commonly used reductions, including the one-versus-all reduction, a reduction to multiclass classification, and normalised versions of the same, wherein the contribution of each instance is normalised by the number of relevant labels. Our main result is a formal justification of each reduction: we explicate their underlying risks, and show they are each consistent with respect to either precision or recall.

An example of such problem is unsupervised learning of a visual motion detector from pairs of consecutive video frames.

Unfortunately, it is difficult to map their model onto a biologically plausible neural network (NN) with local learning rules. Here we propose a biologically plausible model of motion detection. We also adopt the transformation-operator approach but, instead of reconstruction-error minimization, start with a similarity-preserving objective function. An online algorithm that optimizes such an objective function naturally maps onto an NN with biologically plausible learning rules.

Observing that humans use binocular vision to understand the world, we study in this paper whether the 3D viewpoint generalizability of CNNs can be achieved via a binocular vision.

In this work we aim to learn object representations that are useful for control and reinforcement learning (RL). To this end, we introduce Transporter, a neural network architecture for discovering concise geometric object representations in terms of keypoints or image-space coordinates. Our method learns from raw video frames in a fully unsupervised manner, by transporting learnt image features between video frames using a keypoint bottleneck. The discovered keypoints track objects and object parts across long time-horizons more accurately than recent similar methods. Furthermore, consistent long-term tracking enables two notable results in control domains -- (1) using the keypoint co-ordinates and corresponding image features as inputs enables highly sample-efficient reinforcement learning; (2) learning to explore by controlling keypoint locations drastically reduces the search space, enabling deep exploration (leading to states unreachable through random action exploration) without any extrinsic rewards.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/dae3312c4c6c7000a37ecfb7b0aeb0e4-Paper.pdf,2019,"object, image, representations, keypoint, learning, control, enables, exploration, features, frames","keypoints, learning, keypoint, object, xt, using, exploration, image, control, random","{'keypoints': 0.539039260473961, 'perception': 0.5101678807094816, 'control': 0.3825846015364553, 'object': 0.3750823445014875, 'unsupervised': 0.36513051379091976, 'learning': 0.1696684253752585}","{'object': 0.34371513892977973, 'keypoint': 0.3087084590688547, 'representations': 0.22328919229548908, 'image': 0.20301214650378308, 'keypoints': 0.1976184473056187, 'frames': 0.19108110068953543, 'video': 0.15529107508977574, 'exploration': 0.13924742967388648, 'long': 0.13581504903196862, 'enables': 0.13527656594190854}"
G2SAT: Learning to Generate SAT Formulas,"Jiaxuan You, Haoze Wu, Clark Barrett, Raghuram Ramanujan, Jure Leskovec","The Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem is the canonical NP-complete problem and is fundamental to computer science, with a wide array of applications in planning, verification, and theorem proving. Developing and evaluating practical SAT solvers relies on extensive empirical testing on a set of real-world benchmark formulas. However, the availability of such real-world SAT formulas is limited. While these benchmark formulas can be augmented with synthetically generated ones, existing approaches for doing so are heavily hand-crafted and fail to simultaneously capture a wide range of characteristics exhibited by real-world SAT instances. In this work, we present G2SAT, the first deep generative framework that learns to generate SAT formulas from a given set of input formulas. Our key insight is that SAT formulas can be transformed into latent bipartite graph representations which we model using a specialized deep generative neural network. We show that G2SAT can generate SAT formulas that closely resemble given real-world SAT instances, as measured by both graph metrics and SAT solver behavior. Further, we show that our synthetic SAT formulas could be used to improve SAT solver performance on real-world benchmarks, which opens up new opportunities for the continued development of SAT solvers and a deeper understanding of their performance.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/daea32adcae6abcb548134fa98f139f9-Paper.pdf,2019,"sat, formulas, real, world, benchmark, deep, g2sat, generate, generative, given","sat, formulas, graph, node, g2sat, gi, graphs, bipartite, generated, nodes","{'formulas': 0.5003239710823616, 'g2sat': 0.5003239710823616, 'sat': 0.5003239710823616, 'generate': 0.4735262136023402, 'learning': 0.15748237016428107}","{'sat': 0.74935008731978, 'formulas': 0.4512363789693873, 'world': 0.14444470267990914, 'g2sat': 0.13195954122108952, 'real': 0.1205457699658507, 'solver': 0.1007265082647303, 'solvers': 0.09465500444525471, 'instances': 0.0806335896892609, 'generate': 0.07296458433784186, 'wide': 0.06949347530837108}"

Therefore, we design a margin distribution reweighting approach for deep forest to achieve a small margin ratio by boosting the augmented feature.

Diffeomorphic Temporal Alignment Nets,"Ron A. Shapira Weber, Matan Eyal, Nicki Skafte, Oren Shriki, Oren Freifeld","Time-series analysis is confounded by nonlinear time warping of the data. Traditional methods for joint alignment do not generalize: after aligning a given signal ensemble, they lack a mechanism, that does not require solving a new optimization problem, to align previously-unseen signals. In the multi-class case, they must also first classify the test data before aligning it. Here we propose the Diffeomorphic Temporal alignment Net (DTAN), a learning-based method for time-series joint alignment. Via flexible temporal transformer layers, DTAN learns and applies an input-dependent nonlinear time warping to its input signal. Once learned, DTAN easily aligns previously-unseen signals by its inexpensive forward pass. In a single-class case, the method is unsupervised: the ground-truth alignments are unknown. In the multi-class case, it is semi-supervised in the sense that class labels (but not the ground-truth alignments) are used during learning; in test time, however, the class labels are unknown. As we show, DTAN not only outperforms existing joint-alignment methods in aligning training data but also generalizes well to test data.

Multi-source Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation,"Sicheng Zhao, Bo Li, Xiangyu Yue, Yang Gu, Pengfei Xu, Runbo Hu, Hua Chai, Kurt Keutzer","Simulation-to-real domain adaptation for semantic segmentation has been actively studied for various applications such as autonomous driving. Existing methods mainly focus on a single-source setting, which cannot easily handle a more practical scenario of multiple sources with different distributions. In this paper, we propose to investigate multi-source domain adaptation for semantic segmentation. Specifically, we design a novel framework, termed Multi-source Adversarial Domain Aggregation Network (MADAN), which can be trained in an end-to-end manner. First, we generate an adapted domain for each source with dynamic semantic consistency while aligning at the pixel-level cycle-consistently towards the target. Second, we propose sub-domain aggregation discriminator and cross-domain cycle discriminator to make different adapted domains more closely aggregated. Finally, feature-level alignment is performed between the aggregated domain and target domain while training the segmentation network. Extensive experiments from synthetic GTA and SYNTHIA to real Cityscapes and BDDS datasets demonstrate that the proposed MADAN model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

On Exact Computation with an Infinitely Wide Neural Net,"Sanjeev Arora, Simon S. Du, Wei Hu, Zhiyuan Li, Russ R.

Such questions have come to the forefront in the quest to theoretically understand deep learning and its mysteries about optimization and generalization. They also connect deep learning to notions such as Gaussian processes and kernels. A recent paper [Jacot et al., 2018] introduced the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) which captures the behavior of fully-connected deep nets in the infinite width limit trained by gradient descent; this object was implicit in some other recent papers. An attraction of such ideas is that a pure kernel-based method is used to capture the power of a fully-trained deep net of infinite width.The current paper gives the first efficient exact algorithm for computing the extension of NTK to convolutional neural nets, which we call Convolutional NTK (CNTK), as well as an efficient GPU implementation of this algorithm. This results in a significant new benchmark for performance of a pure kernel-based method on CIFAR-10, being 10% higher than the methods reported in [Novak et al., 2019], and only 6% lower than the performance of the corresponding finite deep net architecture (once batch normalization etc. are turned off).

Recent results require $N$ hidden nodes to memorize/interpolate arbitrary $N$ data points. In contrast, by exploiting depth, we show that 3-layer ReLU networks with $\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ hidden nodes can perfectly memorize most datasets with $N$ points. We also prove that width $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ is necessary and sufficient for memorizing $N$ data points, proving tight bounds on memorization capacity. The sufficiency result can be extended to deeper networks; we show that an $L$-layer network with $W$ parameters in the hidden layers can memorize $N$ data points if $W = \Omega(N)$. Combined with a recent upper bound $O(WL\log W)$ on VC dimension, our construction is nearly tight for any fixed $L$. Subsequently, we analyze memorization capacity of residual networks under a general position assumption; we prove results that substantially reduce the known requirement of $N$ hidden nodes.

Control Batch Size and Learning Rate to Generalize Well: Theoretical and Empirical Evidence,"Fengxiang He, Tongliang Liu, Dacheng Tao","Deep neural networks have received dramatic success based on the optimization method of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). However, it is still not clear how to tune hyper-parameters, especially batch size and learning rate, to ensure good generalization. This paper reports both theoretical and empirical evidence of a training strategy that we should control the ratio of batch size to learning rate not too large to achieve a good generalization ability. Specifically, we prove a PAC-Bayes generalization bound for neural networks trained by SGD, which has a positive correlation with the ratio of batch size to learning rate. This correlation builds the theoretical foundation of the training strategy. Furthermore, we conduct a large-scale experiment to verify the correlation and training strategy. We trained 1,600 models based on architectures ResNet-110, and VGG-19 with datasets CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 while strictly control unrelated variables.

Classification-by-Components: Probabilistic Modeling of Reasoning over a Set of Components,"Sascha Saralajew, Lars Holdijk, Maike Rees, Ebubekir Asan, Thomas Villmann","Abstract Neural networks are state-of-the-art classification approaches but are generally difficult to interpret. This issue can be partly alleviated by constructing a precise decision process within the neural network. In this work, a network architecture, denoted as Classification-By-Components network (CBC), is proposed. It is restricted to follow an intuitive reasoning based decision process inspired by Biederman's recognition-by-components theory from cognitive psychology. The network is trained to learn and detect generic components that characterize objects. In parallel, a class-wise reasoning strategy based on these components is learned to solve the classification problem. In contrast to other work on reasoning, we propose three different types of reasoning: positive, negative, and indefinite. These three types together form a probability space to provide a probabilistic classifier. The decomposition of objects into generic components combined with the probabilistic reasoning provides by design a clear interpretation of the classification decision process. The evaluation of the approach on MNIST shows that CBCs are viable classifiers. Additionally, we demonstrate that the inherent interpretability offers a profound understanding of the classification behavior such that we can explain the success of an adversarial attack. The method's scalability is successfully tested using the ImageNet dataset.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/dca5672ff3444c7e997aa9a2c4eb2094-Paper.pdf,2019,"classification, components, reasoning, network, decision, process, based, generic, neural, objects","reasoning, components, class, probability, cbc, component, classiﬁcation, input, detection, model","{'components': 0.7509865934534908, 'set': 0.33108754388189343, 'probabilistic': 0.3179164892736741, 'reasoning': 0.3028394548511504, 'classification': 0.26033968182060285, 'modeling': 0.25659461265249445}","{'reasoning': 0.3902389297842224, 'components': 0.3703504314400096, 'classification': 0.24476133527846056, 'decision': 0.18086093768745576, 'generic': 0.16232246845626128, 'network': 0.15620378908278346, 'process': 0.15508421818860688, 'types': 0.1417879088850867, 'objects': 0.13838084260366537, 'probabilistic': 0.1325019359735867}"
Recurrent Registration Neural Networks for Deformable Image Registration,"Robin Sandkühler, Simon Andermatt, Grzegorz Bauman, Sylvia Nyilas, Christoph Jud, Philippe C. Cattin","Parametric spatial transformation models have been successfully applied to image
registration tasks. In such models, the transformation of interest is parameterized
by a fixed set of basis functions as for example B-splines. Each basis function
is located on a fixed regular grid position among the image domain because the
transformation of interest is not known in advance. As a consequence, not all basis
functions will necessarily contribute to the final transformation which results in a
non-compact representation of the transformation. We reformulate the pairwise
registration problem as a recursive sequence of successive alignments. For each
element in the sequence, a local deformation defined by its position, shape, and
weight is computed by our recurrent registration neural network. The sum of all lo-
cal deformations yield the final spatial alignment of both images. Formulating the
registration problem in this way allows the network to detect non-aligned regions in
the images and to learn how to locally refine the registration properly. In contrast to
current non-sequence-based registration methods, our approach iteratively applies
local spatial deformations to the images until the desired registration accuracy
is achieved. We trained our network on 2D magnetic resonance images of the
lung and compared our method to a standard parametric B-spline registration. The
experiments show, that our method performs on par for the accuracy but yields a
more compact representation of the transformation. Furthermore, we achieve a
speedup of around 15 compared to the B-spline registration.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/dd03de08bfdff4d8ab01117276564cc7-Paper.pdf,2019,"registration, transformation, images, basis, network, non, sequence, spatial, accuracy, compact","registration, image, transformation, network, images, position, figure, spatial, local, sequence","{'registration': 0.780526768161599, 'deformable': 0.406588991693561, 'recurrent': 0.2935210038716434, 'image': 0.2688172329430921, 'networks': 0.1830929703399679, 'neural': 0.1830929703399679}","{'registration': 0.6426283681713468, 'transformation': 0.3218738815010654, 'basis': 0.17274290807841416, 'images': 0.1646499282905356, 'deformations': 0.1517535876460582, 'spatial': 0.1514146426303531, 'spline': 0.1428063040380771, 'sequence': 0.1358574873404822, 'position': 0.12751082168330957, 'compact': 0.11737045202938542}"
User-Specified Local Differential Privacy in Unconstrained Adaptive Online Learning,Dirk van der Hoeven,"Local differential privacy is a strong notion of privacy in which the provider of the data guarantees privacy by perturbing the data with random noise. In the standard application of local differential differential privacy the distribution of the noise is constant and known by the learner. In this paper we generalize this approach by allowing the provider of the data to choose the distribution of the noise without disclosing any parameters of the distribution to the learner, under the constraint that the distribution is symmetrical. We consider this problem in the unconstrained Online Convex Optimization setting with noisy feedback. In this setting the learner receives the subgradient of a loss function, perturbed by noise, and aims to achieve sublinear regret with respect to some competitor, without constraints on the norm of the competitor. We derive the first algorithms that have adaptive regret bounds in this setting, i.e. our algorithms adapt to the unknown competitor norm, unknown noise, and unknown sum of the norms of the subgradients, matching state of the art bounds in all cases.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/ddb4955263e6c08179393d1beaf18602-Paper.pdf,2019,"noise, distribution, privacy, competitor, data, differential, learner, setting, unknown, algorithms","gt, privacy, algorithm, regret, local, noise, differential, ft, orabona, wt","{'specified': 0.43768856157435004, 'user': 0.41424560740312555, 'unconstrained': 0.39761256671600714, 'differential': 0.32518102015242595, 'privacy': 0.32518102015242595, 'local': 0.31746057699932145, 'online': 0.27560544364182854, 'adaptive': 0.26744864038697175, 'learning': 0.13776719896392253}","{'competitor': 0.340142449637741, 'noise': 0.3222214186786523, 'privacy': 0.3171551968769659, 'provider': 0.2652566367781497, 'learner': 0.24744912635092162, 'differential': 0.22766165586384635, 'distribution': 0.20470138286808323, 'unknown': 0.19959055087519212, 'setting': 0.16531725704247194, 'norm': 0.15694755279651762}"
Learning Representations by Maximizing Mutual Information Across Views,"Philip Bachman, R Devon Hjelm, William Buchwalter","We propose an approach to self-supervised representation learning based on maximizing mutual information between features extracted from multiple views of a shared context. For example, one could produce multiple views of a local spatio-temporal context by observing it from different locations (e.g., camera positions within a scene), and via different modalities (e.g., tactile, auditory, or visual). Or, an ImageNet image could provide a context from which one produces multiple views by repeatedly applying data augmentation. Maximizing mutual information between features extracted from these views requires capturing information about high-level factors whose influence spans multiple views – e.g., presence of certain objects or occurrence of certain events. Following our proposed approach, we develop a model which learns image representations that significantly outperform prior methods on the tasks we consider. Most notably, using self-supervised learning, our model learns representations which achieve 68.1% accuracy on ImageNet using standard linear evaluation.  This beats prior results by over 12% and concurrent results by 7%. When we extend our model to use mixture-based representations, segmentation behaviour emerges as a natural side-effect.

Exploration Bonus for Regret Minimization in Discrete and Continuous Average Reward MDPs,"Jian QIAN, Ronan Fruit, Matteo Pirotta, Alessandro Lazaric","The exploration bonus is an effective approach to manage the exploration-exploitation trade-off in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).

We first introduce SCAL+, a variant of SCAL (Fruit et al. 2018), that uses a suitable exploration bonus to solve any discrete unknown weakly-communicating MDP for which an upper bound $c$ on the span of the optimal bias function is known. We prove that SCAL+ enjoys the same regret guarantees as SCAL, which relies on the less efficient extended value iteration approach.
Furthermore, we leverage the flexibility provided by the exploration bonus scheme to generalize SCAL+ to smooth MDPs with continuous state space and discrete actions.

A neurally plausible model learns successor representations in partially observable environments,"Eszter Vértes, Maneesh Sahani","Animals need to devise strategies to maximize returns while interacting with their environment based on incoming noisy sensory observations. Task-relevant states, such as the agent's location within an environment or the presence of a predator, are often not directly observable but must be inferred using available sensory information. Successor representations (SR) have been proposed as a middle-ground between model-based and model-free reinforcement learning strategies, allowing for fast value computation and rapid adaptation to changes in the reward function or goal locations.  Indeed, recent studies suggest that features of neural responses are consistent with the SR framework.  However, it is not clear how such representations might be learned and computed in partially observed, noisy environments. Here, we introduce a neurally plausible model using \emph{distributional successor features}, which builds on the distributed distributional code for the representation and computation of uncertainty, and which allows for efficient value function computation in partially observed environments via the successor representation. We show that distributional successor features can support reinforcement learning in noisy environments in which direct learning of successful policies is infeasible.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/dea184826614d3f4c608731389ed0c74-Paper.pdf,2019,"successor, computation, distributional, environments, features, learning, model, noisy, based, environment","st, model, ot, state, learning, latent, sfs, successor, distributional, states","{'neurally': 0.3680921275981876, 'plausible': 0.3680921275981876, 'learns': 0.3533122694040837, 'observable': 0.3533122694040837, 'partially': 0.3533122694040837, 'successor': 0.3533122694040837, 'environments': 0.3418481207442622, 'representations': 0.24979528391838637, 'model': 0.22458920461672427}","{'successor': 0.4347294323051068, 'distributional': 0.2521738897821068, 'environments': 0.2259997697837836, 'sr': 0.2103117445034913, 'noisy': 0.19610112551437073, 'computation': 0.19034728670489715, 'sensory': 0.18011057986107978, 'features': 0.1655897692597431, 'partially': 0.1620771807886417, 'strategies': 0.15367901340292078}"
Tight Dimension Independent Lower Bound on the Expected Convergence Rate for Diminishing Step Sizes in SGD,"PHUONG_HA NGUYEN, Lam Nguyen, Marten van Dijk",We study the convergence of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for strongly convex  objective functions. We prove for all $t$ a lower bound on the expected convergence rate after the $t$-th SGD iteration; the lower bound is over all possible sequences of diminishing step sizes. It implies that recently proposed sequences of step sizes at ICML 2018 and ICML 2019 are {\em universally} close to optimal in that the expected convergence rate after {\em each} iteration is within a factor $32$ of our lower bound. This factor is independent of dimension $d$.

Cost Effective Active Search,"Shali Jiang, Roman Garnett, Benjamin Moseley","We study a special paradigm of active learning, called cost effective active search, where the goal is to find a given number of positive points from a large unlabeled pool with minimum labeling cost. Most existing methods solve this problem heuristically, and few theoretical results have been established. We adopt a principled Bayesian approach for the first time. We first derive the Bayesian optimal policy and establish a strong hardness result: the optimal policy is hard to approximate, with the best-possible approximation ratio lower bounded by $\Omega(n^{0.16})$. We then propose an efficient and nonmyopic policy using the negative Poisson binomial distribution. We propose simple and fast approximations for computing its expectation, which serves as an essential role in our proposed policy.

Optimal Statistical Rates for Decentralised Non-Parametric Regression with Linear Speed-Up,"Dominic Richards, Patrick Rebeschini","We analyse the learning performance of Distributed Gradient Descent in the context of multi-agent decentralised non-parametric regression with the square loss function when i.i.d. samples are assigned to agents. We show that if agents hold sufficiently many samples with respect to the network size, then Distributed Gradient Descent achieves optimal statistical rates with a number of iterations that scales, up to a threshold, with the inverse of the spectral gap of the gossip matrix divided by the number of samples owned by each agent raised to a problem-dependent power. The presence of the threshold comes from statistics. It encodes the existence of a ""big data"" regime where the number of required iterations does not depend on the network topology. In this regime, Distributed Gradient Descent achieves optimal statistical rates with the same order of iterations as gradient descent run with all the samples in the network. Provided the communication delay is sufficiently small, the distributed protocol yields a linear speed-up in runtime compared to the single-machine protocol. This is in contrast to decentralised optimisation algorithms that do not exploit statistics and only yield a linear speed-up in graphs where the spectral gap is bounded away from zero. Our results exploit the statistical concentration of quantities held by agents and shed new light on the interplay between statistics and communication in decentralised methods.

Inherent Weight Normalization in Stochastic Neural Networks,"Georgios Detorakis, Sourav Dutta, Abhishek Khanna, Matthew Jerry, Suman Datta, Emre Neftci","Multiplicative stochasticity such as Dropout improves the robustness and gener-
alizability deep neural networks. Here, we further demonstrate that always-on
multiplicative stochasticity combined with simple threshold neurons provide a suf-
ficient substrate for deep learning machines. We call such models Neural Sampling Machines (NSM). We find that the probability of activation of the NSM exhibits a self-normalizing property that mirrors Weight Normalization, a previously studied mechanism that fulfills many of the features of Batch Normalization in an online fashion. The normalization of activities during training speeds up convergence by preventing internal covariate shift caused by changes in the distribution of inputs. The always-on stochasticity of the NSM confers the following advantages: the network is identical in the inference and learning phases, making the NSM a suitable substrate for continual learning, it can exploit stochasticity inherent to a physical substrate such as analog non-volatile memories for in memory computing, and it is suitable for Monte Carlo sampling, while requiring almost exclusively addition and comparison operations.

Universality in Learning from Linear Measurements,"Ehsan Abbasi, Fariborz Salehi, Babak Hassibi","We study the problem of recovering a structured signal from independently and identically drawn linear measurements. A convex penalty function $f(\cdot)$ is considered which penalizes deviations from the desired structure, and signal recovery is performed by minimizing $f(\cdot)$ subject to the linear measurement constraints. The main question of interest is to determine the minimum number of measurements that is necessary and sufficient for the perfect recovery of the unknown signal with high probability. Our main result states that, under some mild conditions on $f(\cdot)$ and on the distribution from which the linear measurements are drawn, the minimum number of measurements required for perfect recovery depends only on the first and second order statistics of the measurement vectors. As a result, the required of number of measurements can be determining by studying measurement vectors that are Gaussian (and have the same mean vector and covariance matrix) for which a rich literature and comprehensive theory exists. As an application, we show that the minimum number of random quadratic measurements (also known as rank-one projections) required to recover a low rank positive semi-definite matrix is $3nr$, where $n$ is the dimension of the matrix and $r$ is its rank. As a consequence, we settle the long standing open question of determining the minimum number of measurements required for perfect signal recovery in phase retrieval using the celebrated PhaseLift algorithm, and show it to be $3n$.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/dffbb6efd376d8dbb22cdf491e481edc-Paper.pdf,2019,"measurements, number, minimum, recovery, required, signal, cdot, linear, matrix, measurement","x0, matrix, measurements, vectors, measurement, gaussian, ai, phase, recovery, estimator","{'measurements': 0.6290128017654584, 'universality': 0.6290128017654584, 'linear': 0.4061083946617663, 'learning': 0.20919312181708943}","{'measurements': 0.44803843528575116, 'recovery': 0.2652010763714641, 'minimum': 0.24153839674044306, 'signal': 0.23422910129382865, 'perfect': 0.2334993071965782, 'cdot': 0.22507356209922103, 'required': 0.2133641268361273, 'measurement': 0.20287914697531156, 'number': 0.17356681141826957, 'rank': 0.1650651475194816}"
Discrimination in Online Markets: Effects of Social Bias on Learning from Reviews and Policy Design,"Faidra Georgia Monachou, Itai Ashlagi","The increasing popularity of online two-sided markets such as ride-sharing, accommodation and freelance labor platforms, goes hand in hand with new socioeconomic challenges.  One major issue remains the existence of bias and discrimination against certain social groups. We study this problem using  a two-sided large market model with  employers and workers mediated by a platform. Employers who seek to hire  workers face uncertainty about a candidate worker's  skill level. Therefore, they base their hiring decision  on learning from past reviews about an individual worker as well as on their (possibly misspecified)  prior beliefs about the ability level of the social group the worker belongs to. Drawing upon the  social learning literature with bounded rationality and limited information, uncertainty combined with social bias leads to  unequal hiring opportunities between workers of different social groups. Although the effect of social bias decreases as the number of reviews increases (consistent with empirical findings), minority workers still receive lower expected  payoffs. Finally, we  consider a simple directed matching policy (DM), which combines learning and matching to make better matching decisions for minority workers. Under this policy, there exists a steady-state equilibrium, in which  DM reduces the discrimination gap.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/e00406144c1e7e35240afed70f34166a-Paper.pdf,2019,"social, workers, bias, learning, matching, worker, discrimination, dm, employers, groups","workers, employers, worker, employer, learning, social, minority, discrimination, bias, belief","{'discrimination': 0.38754684834669034, 'markets': 0.38754684834669034, 'reviews': 0.38754684834669034, 'social': 0.3520619696789835, 'design': 0.32341307822799353, 'effects': 0.3165770910112767, 'bias': 0.29172207259899724, 'policy': 0.24723267204431804, 'online': 0.24403201373686859, 'learning': 0.1219845535189981}","{'social': 0.38723228043850166, 'workers': 0.37882563358953214, 'worker': 0.23786944055388426, 'dm': 0.18550006875302516, 'employers': 0.18550006875302516, 'hiring': 0.17556453469452898, 'minority': 0.17556453469452898, 'reviews': 0.168515161094419, 'sided': 0.15857962703592285, 'matching': 0.15323547764359735}"
Structure Learning with Side Information: Sample Complexity,"Saurabh Sihag, Ali Tajer","Graphical models encode the stochastic dependencies among random variables (RVs). The vertices represent the  RVs, and the edges signify the conditional dependencies among the RVs. Structure learning is the process of inferring the edges by observing realizations of the RVs, and it has applications in a wide range of technological, social, and biological networks. Learning the structure of graphs when the vertices are treated in isolation from inferential information known about them is well-investigated. In a wide range of domains, however, often there exist additional inferred knowledge about the structure, which can serve as valuable side information. For instance, the gene networks that represent different subtypes of the same cancer share similar edges across all subtypes and also have exclusive edges corresponding to each subtype, rendering partially similar graphical models for gene expression in different cancer subtypes. Hence, an inferential decision regarding a gene network can serve as side information for inferring other related gene networks.  When such side information is leveraged judiciously, it can translate to significant improvement in structure learning. Leveraging such side information can be abstracted as inferring structures of distinct graphical models that are {\sl partially} similar. This paper focuses on Ising graphical models, and considers the problem of simultaneously learning the structures of two {\sl partially} similar graphs, where any inference about the structure of one graph offers side information for the other graph. The bounded edge subclass of Ising models is considered, and necessary conditions (information-theoretic ), as well as sufficient conditions (algorithmic) for the sample complexity for achieving a bounded probability of error, are established. Furthermore, specific regimes are identified in which the necessary and sufficient conditions coincide, rendering the optimal sample complexity.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/e025b6279c1b88d3ec0eca6fcb6e6280-Paper.pdf,2019,"information, models, side, structure, edges, gene, graphical, learning, rvs, similar","graph, graphs, sample, complexity, log, conditions, al, et, models, iη","{'side': 0.5745896896900573, 'complexity': 0.416756548927726, 'information': 0.403712822884994, 'structure': 0.3892114062916767, 'sample': 0.3859810593553902, 'learning': 0.18085830668595576}","{'rvs': 0.31222517442787756, 'gene': 0.27443361049001147, 'side': 0.2690560953422003, 'subtypes': 0.23416888082090817, 'information': 0.21732939934202916, 'graphical': 0.21332620124617302, 'edges': 0.2114928294036897, 'structure': 0.16769296198290853, 'inferring': 0.16452954448072904, 'similar': 0.1627425840921137}"

Discrete flows have numerous applications. We consider two flow architectures: discrete autoregressive flows that enable bidirectionality, allowing, for example, tokens in text to depend on both left-to-right and right-to-left contexts in an exact language model; and discrete bipartite flows that enable efficient non-autoregressive generation as in RealNVP.

Disentangled behavioural representations,"Amir Dezfouli, Hassan Ashtiani, Omar Ghattas, Richard Nock, Peter Dayan, Cheng Soon Ong","Individual characteristics in human decision-making are often
  quantified by fitting a parametric cognitive model to subjects'
  behavior and then studying differences between them in the associated
  parameter space.  However, these models often fit behavior more poorly
  than recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are more flexible and
  make fewer assumptions about the underlying decision-making processes.
  Unfortunately, the parameter and latent activity spaces of RNNs are
  generally high-dimensional and uninterpretable, making it hard to use
  them to study individual differences.  Here, we
  show how to benefit from the flexibility of RNNs while representing
  individual differences in a low-dimensional and interpretable space.
  To achieve this, we propose a novel end-to-end learning framework in
  which an encoder is trained to map the behavior of subjects into a
  low-dimensional latent space. These low-dimensional representations
  are used to generate the parameters of individual RNNs corresponding
  to the decision-making process of each subject.  We introduce terms
  into the loss function that ensure that the latent dimensions are
  informative and disentangled, i.e.,
encouraged to have distinct effects on behavior. This allows them to
align with separate facets of

A Flexible Generative Framework for Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning,"Jiaqi Ma, Weijing Tang, Ji Zhu, Qiaozhu Mei","We consider a family of problems that are concerned about making predictions for the majority of unlabeled, graph-structured data samples based on a small proportion of labeled samples.  Relational information among the data samples, often encoded in the graph/network structure, is shown to be helpful for these semi-supervised learning tasks. However, conventional graph-based regularization methods and recent graph neural networks do not fully leverage the interrelations between the features, the graph, and the labels. In this work, we propose a flexible generative framework for graph-based semi-supervised learning, which approaches the joint distribution of the node features, labels, and the graph structure. Borrowing insights from random graph models in network science literature, this joint distribution can be instantiated using various distribution families. For the inference of missing labels, we exploit recent advances of scalable variational inference techniques to approximate the Bayesian posterior. We conduct thorough experiments on benchmark datasets for graph-based semi-supervised learning.

A New Perspective on Pool-Based Active Classification and False-Discovery Control,"Lalit Jain, Kevin G. Jamieson","In many scientific settings there is a need for adaptive experimental design to guide the process of identifying regions of the search space that contain as many true positives as possible subject to a low rate of false discoveries (i.e. false alarms). Such regions of the search space could differ drastically from a predicted set that minimizes 0/1 error and accurate identification could require very different sampling strategies. Like active learning for binary classification, this experimental design cannot be optimally chosen a priori, but rather the data must be taken sequentially and adaptively in a closed loop. However, unlike classification with 0/1 error, collecting data adaptively to find a set with high true positive rate and low false discovery rate (FDR) is not as well understood.

Which Algorithmic Choices Matter at Which Batch Sizes?

In this work, we study how the critical batch size changes based on properties of the optimization algorithm, including acceleration and preconditioning, through two different lenses: large scale experiments and analysis using a simple noisy quadratic model (NQM). We experimentally demonstrate that optimization algorithms that employ preconditioning, specifically Adam and K-FAC, result in much larger critical batch sizes than stochastic gradient descent with momentum. We also demonstrate that the NQM captures many of the essential features of real neural network training, despite being drastically simpler to work with. The NQM predicts our results with preconditioned optimizers, previous results with accelerated gradient descent, and other results around optimal learning rates and large batch training, making it a useful tool to generate testable predictions about neural network optimization.

Using Statistics to Automate Stochastic Optimization,"Hunter Lang, Lin Xiao, Pengchuan Zhang","Despite the development of numerous adaptive optimizers, tuning the learning rate of stochastic gradient methods remains a major roadblock to obtaining good practical performance in machine learning. Rather than changing the learning rate at each iteration, we propose an approach that automates the most common hand-tuning heuristic: use a constant learning rate until ""progress stops,"" then drop. We design an explicit statistical test that determines when the dynamics of stochastic gradient descent reach a stationary distribution. This test can be performed easily during training, and when it fires, we decrease the learning rate by a constant multiplicative factor.

For both the IID and Markov noise cases, we show that the evolution of some augmented versions of the mean and covariance matrix of the TD estimation error exactly follows the trajectory of a deterministic linear time-invariant (LTI) dynamical system. Applying the well-known LTI system theory, we obtain closed-form expressions for the mean and covariance matrix of the TD estimation error at any time step. We provide a tight matrix spectral radius condition to guarantee the convergence of the covariance matrix of the TD estimation error, and perform a perturbation analysis to characterize the dependence of the TD behaviors on learning rate. For the IID case, we provide an exact formula characterizing how the mean and covariance matrix of the TD estimation error converge to the steady state values at a linear rate. For the Markov case, we use our formulas to explain how the behaviors of TD learning algorithms are affected by learning rate and the underlying Markov chain.

Generalization in Reinforcement Learning with Selective Noise Injection and Information Bottleneck,"Maximilian Igl, Kamil Ciosek, Yingzhen Li, Sebastian Tschiatschek, Cheng Zhang, Sam Devlin, Katja Hofmann","The ability for policies to generalize to new environments is key to the broad application of RL agents. A promising approach to prevent an agent’s policy from overfitting to a limited set of training environments is to apply regularization techniques originally developed for supervised learning. However, there are stark differences between supervised learning and RL. We discuss those differences and propose modifications to existing regularization techniques in order to better adapt them to RL. In particular, we focus on regularization techniques relying on the injection of noise into the learned function, a family that includes some of the most widely used approaches such as Dropout and Batch Normalization. To adapt them to RL, we propose Selective Noise Injection (SNI), which maintains the regularizing effect the injected noise has, while mitigating the adverse effects it has on the gradient quality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Information Bottleneck (IB) is a particularly well suited regularization technique for RL as it is effective in the low-data regime encountered early on in training RL agents. Combining the IB with SNI, we significantly outperform current state of the art results, including on the recently proposed generalization benchmark Coinrun.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/e2ccf95a7f2e1878fcafc8376649b6e8-Paper.pdf,2019,"rl, regularization, noise, techniques, adapt, agents, differences, environments, ib, injection","data, policy, regularization, rl, training, sni, techniques, ibac, learning, noise","{'injection': 0.4712840509431684, 'bottleneck': 0.4281319586552619, 'selective': 0.4281319586552619, 'noise': 0.345845639690622, 'information': 0.33112918313862005, 'generalization': 0.30698871997372346, 'reinforcement': 0.2565040083415556, 'learning': 0.1483417418569703}","{'rl': 0.4353861830232992, 'regularization': 0.2718066953902693, 'ib': 0.24276038092319827, 'sni': 0.24276038092319827, 'injection': 0.2297579381266556, 'noise': 0.1769364083556529, 'differences': 0.17056602376559615, 'techniques': 0.1663995036806805, 'adapt': 0.16586474799898746, 'environments': 0.1528623052024448}"
Untangling in Invariant Speech Recognition,"Cory Stephenson, Jenelle Feather, Suchismita Padhy, Oguz Elibol, Hanlin Tang, Josh McDermott, SueYeon Chung","Encouraged by the success of deep convolutional neural networks on a variety of visual tasks, much theoretical and experimental work has been aimed at understanding and interpreting how vision networks operate.  At the same time, deep neural networks have also achieved impressive performance in audio processing applications, both as sub-components of larger systems and as complete end-to-end systems by themselves.  Despite their empirical successes, comparatively little is understood about how these audio models accomplish these tasks.In this work, we employ a recently developed statistical mechanical theory that connects geometric properties of network representations and the separability of classes to probe how information is untangled within neural networks trained to recognize speech.  We observe that speaker-specific nuisance variations are discarded by the network's hierarchy, whereas task-relevant properties such as words and phonemes are untangled in later layers. Higher level concepts such as parts-of-speech and context dependence also emerge in the later layers of the network. Finally, we find that the deep representations carry out significant temporal untangling by efficiently extracting task-relevant features at each time step of the computation.  Taken together, these findings shed light on how deep auditory models process their time dependent input signals to carry out invariant speech recognition, and show how different concepts emerge through the layers of the network.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/e2db7186375992e729165726762cb4c1-Paper.pdf,2019,"deep, network, networks, layers, neural, speech, time, also, audio, carry","manifold, conv2d, gru, capacity, manifolds, word, model, speech, pool, input","{'untangling': 0.5487112404570768, 'speech': 0.5193218216040875, 'invariant': 0.4984696970816343, 'recognition': 0.4251456001103763}","{'speech': 0.262795573623663, 'untangled': 0.23274572131836074, 'carry': 0.20457430681091401, 'emerge': 0.19422944734833272, 'layers': 0.18581806599268025, 'audio': 0.18033313711705776, 'later': 0.175197049082442, 'deep': 0.16011089475471937, 'concepts': 0.15765561256686328, 'network': 0.15171284842644608}"

The proposed method has linear stepwise computational complexity w.r.t. the number of observed variables.
Our experiments on synthetic data demonstrate that our approach is the only method that recovers modular structure better as the dimensionality increases. We also use our approach for estimating covariance structure for a number of real-world datasets and show that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art estimators at a fraction of the computational cost.

Graph-based Discriminators: Sample Complexity and Expressiveness,"Roi Livni, Yishay Mansour","A basic question in learning theory is to identify if two
distributions are identical when we have access only to examples sampled from the distributions.
This basic task is considered, for example, in the context of
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), where a discriminator is trained to distinguish between a real-life distribution and a synthetic distribution.
Classically, we use a hypothesis class $H$ and claim that the two
distributions are distinct if for some $h\in H$ the expected value
on the two distributions is (significantly) different.

Our starting point is the following fundamental problem: ""is having
the hypothesis dependent on more than a single random example
beneficial"". To address this challenge we define $k$-ary based
discriminators, which have a family of Boolean $k$-ary functions
$\G$. Each function $g\in \G$ naturally defines a hyper-graph,
indicating whether a given hyper-edge exists. A function $g\in \G$
distinguishes between two distributions, if the expected value of
$g$, on a $k$-tuple of i.i.d examples, on the two distributions is
(significantly) different.

We study the expressiveness of families of $k$-ary functions,
compared to the classical hypothesis class $H$, which is $k=1$. We
show a separation in expressiveness of $k+1$-ary versus $k$-ary
functions. This demonstrate the great benefit of having $k\geq 2$ as
distinguishers.

For $k\geq 2$ we introduce a notion similar to the VC-dimension, and
show that it controls the sample complexity. We proceed and provide upper and
lower bounds as a function of our extended notion of VC-dimension.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/e2eabaf96372e20a9e3d4b5f83723a61-Paper.pdf,2019,"distributions, ary, two, function, functions, hypothesis, basic, class, different, dimension","class, distinguishing, graph, vc, complexity, sample, dimension, p2, two, distributions","{'discriminators': 0.5287361763408117, 'expressiveness': 0.5287361763408117, 'complexity': 0.3834984652507441, 'sample': 0.3551789270246565, 'graph': 0.2923548761544311, 'based': 0.2866733245240324}","{'ary': 0.505926552601295, 'distributions': 0.298136096204246, 'hypothesis': 0.2006966918256656, 'vc': 0.18279237126946624, 'geq': 0.17466666344423232, 'two': 0.1714864842126878, 'expressiveness': 0.16095327969290088, 'hyper': 0.1502344268898662, 'basic': 0.14483798692687588, 'functions': 0.13428926618143688}"

Surfing: Iterative Optimization Over Incrementally Trained Deep Networks,"Ganlin Song, Zhou Fan, John Lafferty","We investigate a sequential optimization procedure to minimize the empirical risk functional $f_{\hat\theta}(x) = \frac{1}{2}\|G_{\hat\theta}(x) - y\|^2$ for certain families of deep networks $G_{\theta}(x)$. The approach is to optimize a sequence of objective functions that use network parameters obtained during different stages of the training process.  When initialized with random parameters $\theta_0$, we show that the objective  $f_{\theta_0}(x)$ is ``nice'' and easy to optimize with gradient descent. As learning is carried out, we obtain a sequence of generative networks $x \mapsto G_{\theta_t}(x)$ and associated risk functions $f_{\theta_t}(x)$, where $t$ indicates a stage of stochastic gradient descent during training.  Since the parameters of the network do not change by very much in each step, the surface evolves slowly and can be incrementally optimized. The algorithm is formalized and analyzed for a family of expansive networks. We call the procedure {\it surfing} since it rides along the peak of the evolving (negative) empirical risk function, starting from a smooth surface at the beginning of learning and ending with a wavy nonconvex surface after learning is complete.

Rates of Convergence for Large-scale Nearest Neighbor Classification,"Xingye Qiao, Jiexin Duan, Guang Cheng","Nearest neighbor is a popular class of classification methods with many desirable properties. For a large data set which cannot be loaded into the memory of a single machine due to computation, communication, privacy, or ownership limitations, we consider the divide and conquer scheme: the entire data set is divided into small subsamples, on which nearest neighbor predictions are made, and then a final decision is reached by aggregating the predictions on subsamples by majority voting. We name this method the big Nearest Neighbor (bigNN) classifier, and provide its rates of convergence under minimal assumptions, in terms of both the excess risk and the classification instability, which are proven to be the same rates as the oracle nearest neighbor classifier and cannot be improved. To significantly reduce the prediction time that is required for achieving the optimal rate, we also consider the pre-training acceleration technique applied to the bigNN method, with proven convergence rate. We find that in the distributed setting, the optimal choice of the neighbor k should scale with both the total sample size and the number of partitions, and there is a theoretical upper limit for the latter.

Hierarchical Optimal Transport for Multimodal Distribution Alignment,"John Lee, Max Dabagia, Eva Dyer, Christopher Rozell","In many machine learning applications, it is necessary to meaningfully aggregate, through alignment, different but related datasets. Optimal transport (OT)-based approaches pose alignment as a divergence minimization problem: the aim is to transform a source dataset to match a target dataset using the Wasserstein distance as a divergence measure. We introduce a hierarchical formulation of OT which leverages clustered structure in data to improve alignment in noisy, ambiguous, or multimodal settings. To solve this numerically, we propose a distributed ADMM algorithm that also exploits the Sinkhorn distance, thus it has an efficient computational complexity that scales quadratically with the size of the largest cluster. When the transformation between two datasets is unitary, we provide performance guarantees that describe when and how well aligned cluster correspondences can be recovered with our formulation, as well as provide worst-case dataset geometry for such a strategy. We apply this method to synthetic datasets that model data as mixtures of low-rank Gaussians and study the impact that different geometric properties of the data have on alignment. Next, we applied our approach to a neural decoding application where the goal is to predict movement directions and instantaneous velocities from populations of neurons in the macaque primary motor cortex. Our results demonstrate that when clustered structure exists in datasets, and is consistent across trials or time points, a hierarchical alignment strategy that leverages such structure can provide significant improvements in cross-domain alignment.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/e41990b122b864f164d2ab96e8322690-Paper.pdf,2019,"alignment, datasets, data, dataset, provide, structure, cluster, clustered, different, distance","alignment, cluster, clusters, data, ot, datasets, structure, hiwa, qij, wasserstein","{'alignment': 0.4990156626665131, 'multimodal': 0.4634371498722052, 'distribution': 0.39688669783851926, 'hierarchical': 0.3824248160286339, 'transport': 0.3782023694977719, 'optimal': 0.2990059420854381}","{'alignment': 0.4650850761037404, 'clustered': 0.1994363184559214, 'ot': 0.18534895460437986, 'cluster': 0.15942248750011453, 'datasets': 0.1584323892115014, 'dataset': 0.15267265752789555, 'structure': 0.14623894023384865, 'leverages': 0.1411117809706645, 'divergence': 0.1394461923162745, 'formulation': 0.13357916298212505}"
Sampled Softmax with Random Fourier Features,"Ankit Singh Rawat, Jiecao Chen, Felix Xinnan X. Yu, Ananda Theertha Suresh, Sanjiv Kumar","The computational cost of training with softmax cross entropy loss grows linearly with the number of classes. For the settings where a large number of classes are involved, a common method to speed up training is to sample a subset of classes and utilize an estimate of the loss gradient based on these classes, known as the sampled softmax method. However, the sampled softmax provides a biased estimate of the gradient unless the samples are drawn from the exact softmax distribution, which is again expensive to compute. Therefore, a widely employed practical approach involves sampling from a simpler distribution in the hope of approximating the exact softmax distribution. In this paper, we develop the first theoretical understanding of the role that different sampling distributions play in determining the quality of sampled softmax. Motivated by our analysis and the work on kernel-based sampling, we propose the Random Fourier Softmax (RF-softmax) method that utilizes the powerful Random Fourier Features to enable more efficient and accurate sampling from an approximate softmax distribution. We show that RF-softmax leads to low bias in estimation in terms of both the full softmax distribution and the full softmax gradient.

Self-Routing Capsule Networks,"Taeyoung Hahn, Myeongjang Pyeon, Gunhee Kim","Capsule networks have recently gained a great deal of interest as a new architecture of neural networks that can be more robust to input perturbations than similar-sized CNNs. Capsule networks have two major distinctions from the conventional CNNs: (i) each layer consists of a set of capsules that specialize in disjoint regions of the feature space and (ii) the routing-by-agreement coordinates connections between adjacent capsule layers. Although the routing-by-agreement is capable of filtering out noisy predictions of capsules by dynamically adjusting their influences, its unsupervised clustering nature causes two weaknesses: (i) high computational complexity and (ii) cluster assumption that may not hold in presence of heavy input noise. In this work, we propose a novel and surprisingly simple routing strategy called self-routing where each capsule is routed independently by its subordinate routing network. Therefore, the agreement between capsules is not required anymore but both poses and activations of upper-level capsules are obtained in a way similar to Mixture-of-Experts.

A Model-Based Reinforcement Learning with Adversarial Training for Online Recommendation,"Xueying Bai, Jian Guan, Hongning Wang","Reinforcement learning is effective in optimizing policies for recommender systems. Current solutions mostly focus on model-free approaches, which require frequent interactions with a real environment, and thus are expensive in model learning. Offline evaluation methods, such as importance sampling, can alleviate such limitations, but usually request a large amount of logged data and do not work well when the action space is large. In this work, we propose a model-based reinforcement learning solution which models the user-agent interaction for offline policy learning via a generative adversarial network.

Multimodal Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning via Task-Aware Modulation,"Risto Vuorio, Shao-Hua Sun, Hexiang Hu, Joseph J.

With the flexibility in the choice of models, those frameworks demonstrate appealing performance on a variety of domains such as few-shot image classification and reinforcement learning. However, one important limitation of such frameworks is that they seek a common initialization shared across the entire task distribution, substantially limiting the diversity of the task distributions that they are able to learn from. In this paper, we augment MAML with the capability to identify the mode of tasks sampled from a multimodal task distribution and adapt quickly through gradient updates. Specifically, we propose a multimodal MAML (MMAML) framework, which is able to modulate its meta-learned prior parameters according to the identified mode, allowing more efficient fast adaptation. We evaluate the proposed model on a diverse set of few-shot learning tasks, including regression, image classification, and reinforcement learning. The results not only demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in modulating the meta-learned prior in response to the characteristics of tasks but also show that training on a multimodal distribution can produce an improvement over unimodal training.

Predicting the Politics of an Image Using Webly Supervised Data,"Christopher Thomas, Adriana Kovashka","The news media shape public opinion, and often, the visual bias they contain is evident for human observers. This bias can be inferred from how different media sources portray different subjects or topics. In this paper, we model visual political bias in contemporary media sources at scale, using webly supervised data. We collect a dataset of over one million unique images and associated news articles from left- and right-leaning news sources, and develop a method to predict the image's political leaning. This problem is particularly challenging because of the enormous intra-class visual and semantic diversity of our data. We propose a two-stage method to tackle this problem. In the first stage, the model is forced to learn relevant visual concepts that, when joined with document embeddings computed from articles paired with the images, enable the model to predict bias. In the second stage, we remove the requirement of the text domain and train a visual classifier from the features of the former model. We show this two-stage approach facilitates learning and outperforms several strong baselines.

How to Initialize your Network? Robust Initialization for WeightNorm & ResNets,"Devansh Arpit, Víctor Campos, Yoshua Bengio","Residual networks (ResNet) and weight normalization play an important role in various deep learning applications. However, parameter initialization strategies have not been studied previously for weight normalized networks and, in practice, initialization methods designed for un-normalized networks are used as a proxy. Similarly, initialization for ResNets have also been studied for un-normalized networks and often under simplified settings ignoring the shortcut connection. To address these issues, we propose a novel parameter initialization strategy that avoids explosion/vanishment of information across layers for weight normalized networks with and without residual connections. The proposed strategy is based on a theoretical analysis using mean field approximation. We run over 2,500 experiments and evaluate our proposal on image datasets showing that the proposed initialization outperforms existing initialization methods in terms of generalization performance, robustness to hyper-parameter values and variance between seeds, especially when networks get deeper in which case existing methods fail to even start training.

Our method can reduce the peak memory consumption on various benchmark networks by $36\%\sim81\%$, which outperforms the reduction achieved by other methods.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/e555ebe0ce426f7f9b2bef0706315e0c-Paper.pdf,2019,"memory, methods, recomputation, consumption, method, problem, reduce, results, 36, achieved","memory, gb, recomputation, computation, strategy, algorithm, li, consumption, computational, method","{'recomputation': 0.47128639203221, 'backpropagation': 0.428134085387611, 'theoretic': 0.384981778743012, 'memory': 0.34182947209841297, 'framework': 0.31404559236223095, 'algorithms': 0.3092543351228796, 'graph': 0.2605890819300279, 'efficient': 0.25954274437901215}","{'recomputation': 0.4975325067539515, 'memory': 0.26577072212713276, 'consumption': 0.2611706468194127, 'reduce': 0.17591038944823584, 'selectively': 0.16584416891798384, 'sim81': 0.16584416891798384, 'discarded': 0.15696142078875572, 'recomputing': 0.15696142078875572, 'peak': 0.15065901069283738, '36': 0.14577048163485282}"
Gradient based sample selection for online continual learning,"Rahaf Aljundi, Min Lin, Baptiste Goujaud, Yoshua Bengio","A continual learning agent learns online with a non-stationary and never-ending stream of data. The key to such learning process is to overcome the catastrophic forgetting of previously seen data, which is a well known problem of neural networks. To prevent forgetting, a replay buffer is usually employed to store the previous data for the purpose of rehearsal. Previous work often depend on task boundary and i.i.d. assumptions to properly select samples for the replay buffer. In this work, we formulate sample selection as a constraint reduction problem based on the constrained optimization view of continual learning. The goal is to select a fixed subset of constraints that best approximate the feasible region defined by the original constraints. We show that it is equivalent to maximizing the diversity of samples in the replay buffer with parameter gradient as the feature. We further develop a greedy alternative that is cheap and efficient. The advantage of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparing to other alternatives under the continual learning setting. Further comparisons are made against state of the art methods that rely on task boundaries which show comparable or even better results for our method.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/e562cd9c0768d5464b64cf61da7fc6bb-Paper.pdf,2019,"learning, buffer, continual, data, replay, constraints, forgetting, method, previous, problem","buffer, task, selection, data, replay, examples, learning, samples, mnist, 10","{'continual': 0.4710164456313479, 'selection': 0.4634850605938701, 'sample': 0.4018371390470621, 'online': 0.3766730099834183, 'gradient': 0.3454355027622741, 'based': 0.32433227256145813, 'learning': 0.18828795550992286}","{'buffer': 0.3727393742058733, 'continual': 0.3088555769932728, 'replay': 0.297601400738119, 'forgetting': 0.2059037179955152, 'select': 0.18857495512418326, 'constraints': 0.14209936120455968, 'rehearsal': 0.12944397083678058, 'ending': 0.12424645806862443, 'samples': 0.12187835696701799, 'learning': 0.12011569984968617}"
Conditional Structure Generation through Graph Variational Generative Adversarial Nets,"Carl Yang, Peiye Zhuang, Wenhan Shi, Alan Luu, Pan Li","Graph embedding has been intensively studied recently, due to the advance of various neural network models. Theoretical analyses and empirical studies have pushed forward the translation of discrete graph structures into distributed representation vectors, but seldom considered the reverse direction, i.e., generation of graphs from given related context spaces. Particularly, since graphs often become more meaningful when associated with semantic contexts (e.g., social networks of certain communities, gene networks of certain diseases), the ability to infer graph structures according to given semantic conditions could be of great value. While existing graph generative models only consider graph structures without semantic contexts, we formulate the novel problem of conditional structure generation, and propose a novel unified model of graph variational generative adversarial nets (CondGen) to handle the intrinsic challenges of flexible context-structure conditioning and permutation-invariant generation. Extensive experiments on two deliberately created benchmark datasets of real-world context-enriched networks demonstrate the supreme effectiveness and generalizability of CondGen.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/e57c6b956a6521b28495f2886ca0977a-Paper.pdf,2019,"graph, context, generation, networks, semantic, structures, certain, condgen, contexts, generative","graph, graphs, condgen, model, generation, networks, permutation, structure, invariant, gcn","{'nets': 0.4251218948781107, 'conditional': 0.3793447039242401, 'generation': 0.3793447039242401, 'structure': 0.36571859330243034, 'variational': 0.33784190355158866, 'generative': 0.3210930810611821, 'adversarial': 0.3022537200291035, 'graph': 0.29853181814547275}","{'graph': 0.3479292896221446, 'condgen': 0.260292858297185, 'semantic': 0.21588617279226627, 'structures': 0.21332816385135714, 'generation': 0.2070688633751254, 'context': 0.2063372774688294, 'contexts': 0.18112086207089517, 'certain': 0.1416686207867445, 'graphs': 0.14112712989364118, 'pushed': 0.1301464291485925}"
Meta-Weight-Net: Learning an Explicit Mapping For Sample Weighting,"Jun Shu, Qi Xie, Lixuan Yi, Qian Zhao, Sanping Zhou, Zongben Xu, Deyu Meng","Current deep neural networks(DNNs) can easily overfit to biased training data with corrupted labels or class imbalance. Sample re-weighting strategy is commonly used to alleviate this issue by designing a weighting function mapping from training loss to sample weight, and then iterating between weight recalculating and classifier updating. Current approaches, however, need manually pre-specify the weighting function as well as its additional hyper-parameters. It makes them fairly hard to be generally applied in practice due to the significant variation of proper weighting schemes relying on the investigated problem and training data. To address this issue, we propose a method capable of adaptively learning an explicit weighting function directly from data. The weighting function is an MLP with one hidden layer, constituting a universal approximator to almost any continuous functions, making the method able to fit a wide range of weighting function forms including those assumed in conventional research. Guided by a small amount of unbiased meta-data, the parameters of the weighting function can be finely updated simultaneously with the learning process of the classifiers. Synthetic and real experiments substantiate the capability of our method for achieving proper weighting functions in class imbalance and noisy label cases, fully complying with the common settings in traditional methods, and more complicated scenarios beyond conventional cases. This naturally leads to its better accuracy than other state-of-the-art methods.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/e58cc5ca94270acaceed13bc82dfedf7-Paper.pdf,2019,"weighting, function, data, method, training, cases, class, conventional, current, functions","meta, weight, learning, loss, training, data, 10, weighting, function, method","{'explicit': 0.40229243632462364, 'net': 0.40229243632462364, 'weighting': 0.40229243632462364, 'mapping': 0.3912693258610807, 'weight': 0.3912693258610807, 'sample': 0.3074543555069116, 'meta': 0.3049862691058754, 'learning': 0.1440632196125542}","{'weighting': 0.650131977488143, 'function': 0.21085982638584752, 'imbalance': 0.1683033534443988, 'proper': 0.13973221412543413, 'conventional': 0.1311889495350815, 'weight': 0.11708495394987367, 'issue': 0.1164870753944917, 'data': 0.1068734652525839, 'cases': 0.10404318455142826, 'constituting': 0.09843724638168175}"
Thompson Sampling with Information Relaxation Penalties,"Seungki Min, Costis Maglaras, Ciamac C.

With this framework, we define an intuitive family of control policies that include Thompson sampling (TS) and the Bayesian optimal policy as endpoints. Analogous to TS, which, at each decision epoch pulls an arm that is best with respect to the randomly sampled parameters, our algorithms sample entire future reward realizations and take the corresponding best action. However, this is done in the presence of “penalties” that seek to compensate for the availability of future information.We develop several novel policies and performance bounds for MAB problems that vary in terms of improving performance and increasing computational complexity between the two endpoints. Our policies can be viewed as natural generalizations of TS that simultaneously incorporate knowledge of the time horizon and explicitly consider the exploration-exploitation trade-off. We prove associated structural results on performance bounds and suboptimality gaps.

Oracle-Efficient Algorithms for Online Linear Optimization with Bandit Feedback,"Shinji Ito, Daisuke Hatano, Hanna Sumita, Kei Takemura, Takuro Fukunaga, Naonori Kakimura, Ken-Ichi Kawarabayashi","We propose computationally efficient algorithms for \textit{online linear optimization with bandit feedback}, in which a player chooses an \textit{action vector} from a given (possibly infinite) set $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, and then suffers a loss that can be expressed as a linear function in action vectors. Although existing algorithms achieve an optimal regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ for $T$ rounds (ignoring factors of $\mathrm{poly} (d, \log T)$), computationally efficient ways of implementing them have not yet been specified, in particular when $|\mathcal{A}|$ is not bounded by a polynomial size in $d$. A standard way to pursue computational efficiency is to assume that we have an efficient algorithm referred to as \textit{oracle} that solves (offline) linear optimization problems over $\mathcal{A}$. Under this assumption, the computational efficiency of a bandit algorithm can then be measured in terms of \textit{oracle complexity}, i.e., the number of oracle calls. Our contribution is to propose algorithms that offer optimal regret bounds of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ as well as low oracle complexity for both \textit{non-stochastic settings} and \textit{stochastic settings}. Our algorithm for non-stochastic settings has an oracle complexity of $\tilde{O}( T )$ and is the first algorithm that achieves both a regret bound of $\tilde{O}( \sqrt{T} )$ and an oracle complexity of $\tilde{O} ( \mathrm{poly} ( T ) )$, given only linear optimization oracles.

Constraint-based Causal Structure Learning with Consistent Separating Sets,"Honghao Li, Vincent Cabeli, Nadir Sella, Herve Isambert","We consider constraint-based methods for causal structure learning, such as the PC algorithm or any PC-derived algorithms whose ﬁrst step consists in pruning a complete graph to obtain an undirected graph skeleton, which is subsequently oriented. All constraint-based methods perform this ﬁrst step of removing dispensable edges, iteratively, whenever a separating set and corresponding conditional independence can be found. Yet, constraint-based methods lack robustness over sampling noise and are prone to uncover spurious conditional independences in ﬁnite datasets. In particular, there is no guarantee that the separating sets identiﬁed during the iterative pruning step remain consistent with the ﬁnal graph. In this paper, we propose a simple modiﬁcation of PC and PC-derived algorithms so as to ensure that all separating sets identiﬁed to remove dispensable edges are consistent with the ﬁnal graph,thus enhancing the explainability of constraint-basedmethods. It is achieved by repeating the constraint-based causal structure learning scheme, iteratively, while searching for separating sets that are consistent with the graph obtained at the previous iteration. Ensuring the consistency of separating sets can be done at a limited complexity cost, through the use of block-cut tree decomposition of graph skeletons, and is found to increase their validity in terms of actual d-separation. It also signiﬁcantly improves the sensitivity of constraint-based methods while retaining good overall structure learning performance.

We thus improve upon existing methods by significantly simplifying statistical testing and requiring a weaker version of causal faithfulness.

Weakly Supervised Instance Segmentation using the Bounding Box Tightness Prior,"Cheng-Chun Hsu, Kuang-Jui Hsu, Chung-Chi Tsai, Yen-Yu Lin, Yung-Yu Chuang","This paper presents a weakly supervised instance segmentation method that consumes training data with tight bounding box annotations. The major difficulty lies in the uncertain figure-ground separation within each bounding box since there is no supervisory signal about it. We address the difficulty by formulating the problem as a multiple instance learning (MIL) task, and generate positive and negative bags based on the sweeping lines of each bounding box.

Copula-like Variational Inference,"Marcel Hirt, Petros Dellaportas, Alain Durmus","This paper considers a new family of variational distributions motivated by Sklar's theorem. This family is based on new copula-like densities on the hypercube with non-uniform marginals which can be sampled efficiently, i.e. with a complexity linear in the dimension d of the state space. Then, the proposed variational densities that we suggest can be seen as arising from these copula-like densities used as  base distributions on the hypercube with Gaussian quantile functions and sparse rotation matrices as normalizing flows. The latter correspond to a rotation of the marginals with complexity O(d log d). We provide some empirical evidence that such a variational family can also approximate non-Gaussian posteriors and can be beneficial compared to Gaussian approximations.

Towards Hardware-Aware Tractable Learning of Probabilistic Models,"Laura I. Galindez Olascoaga, Wannes Meert, Nimish Shah, Marian Verhelst, Guy Van den Broeck","Smart portable applications increasingly rely on edge computing due to privacy and latency concerns. But guaranteeing always-on functionality comes with two major challenges: heavily resource-constrained hardware; and dynamic application conditions. Probabilistic models present an ideal solution to these challenges: they are robust to missing data, allow for joint predictions and have small data needs. In addition, ongoing efforts in field of tractable learning have resulted in probabilistic models with strict inference efficiency guarantees. However, the current notions of tractability are often limited to model complexity, disregarding the hardware's specifications and constraints.  We propose a novel resource-aware cost metric that takes into consideration the hardware's properties in determining whether the inference task can be efficiently deployed. We use this metric to evaluate the performance versus resource trade-off relevant to the application of interest, and we propose a strategy that selects the device-settings that can optimally meet users' requirements.

Two Time-scale Off-Policy TD Learning: Non-asymptotic Analysis over Markovian Samples,"Tengyu Xu, Shaofeng Zou, Yingbin Liang","Gradient-based temporal difference (GTD) algorithms are widely used in off-policy learning scenarios. Among them, the two time-scale TD with gradient correction (TDC) algorithm has been shown to have superior performance. In contrast to previous studies that characterized the non-asymptotic convergence rate of TDC only under identical and independently distributed (i.i.d.) data samples, we provide the first non-asymptotic convergence analysis for two time-scale TDC under a non-i.i.d.\ Markovian sample path and linear function approximation. We show that the two time-scale TDC can converge as fast as O(log t/t^(2/3)) under diminishing stepsize, and can converge exponentially fast under constant stepsize, but at the cost of a non-vanishing error. We further propose a TDC algorithm with blockwisely diminishing stepsize, and show that it asymptotically converges with an arbitrarily small error at a blockwisely linear convergence rate.

Incremental Few-Shot Learning with Attention Attractor Networks,"Mengye Ren, Renjie Liao, Ethan Fetaya, Richard Zemel","Machine learning classifiers are often trained to recognize a set of pre-defined classes. However, in many applications, it is often desirable to have the flexibility of learning additional concepts, with limited data and without re-training on the full training set. This paper addresses this problem, incremental few-shot learning, where a regular classification network has already been trained to recognize a set of base classes, and several extra novel classes are being considered, each with only a few labeled examples. After learning the novel classes, the model is then evaluated on the overall classification performance on both base and novel classes. To this end, we propose a meta-learning model, the Attention Attractor Network, which regularizes the learning of novel classes. In each episode, we train a set of new weights to recognize novel classes until they converge, and we show that the technique of recurrent back-propagation can back-propagate through the optimization process and facilitate the learning of these parameters.

Modeling Expectation Violation in Intuitive Physics with Coarse Probabilistic Object Representations,"Kevin Smith, Lingjie Mei, Shunyu Yao, Jiajun Wu, Elizabeth Spelke, Josh Tenenbaum, Tomer Ullman","From infancy, humans have expectations about how objects will move and interact. Even young children expect objects not to move through one another, teleport, or disappear. They are surprised by mismatches between physical expectations and perceptual observations, even in unfamiliar scenes with completely novel objects.

We propose ADEPT, a model that uses a coarse (approximate geometry) object-centric representation for dynamic 3D scene understanding. Inference integrates deep recognition networks, extended probabilistic physical simulation, and particle filtering for forming predictions and expectations across occlusion. We also present a new test set for measuring violations of physical expectations, using a range of scenarios derived from developmental psychology.

Outlier Detection and Robust PCA Using a Convex Measure of Innovation,"Mostafa Rahmani, Ping Li","This paper presents a provable  and strong algorithm, termed Innovation Search (iSearch), to robust Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and outlier detection.  An outlier by definition is a data point which  does not participate in forming a low dimensional structure with a large number of data points in the data.  In other word, an outlier carries some innovation with respect to most of the other data points. iSearch ranks the data points based on their values of innovation. A convex optimization problem is proposed whose optimal value is used as our measure of  innovation.  We derive analytical performance guarantees for the proposed robust PCA method  under different models for the distribution of the outliers including randomly distributed outliers, clustered outliers, and linearly dependent outliers.  Moreover, it is shown that iSearch provably recovers the span of the inliers when the inliers lie in a union of subspaces.

Deep Model Transferability from Attribution Maps,"Jie Song, Yixin Chen, Xinchao Wang, Chengchao Shen, Mingli Song","Exploring the transferability between heterogeneous tasks sheds light on their intrinsic interconnections, and consequently enables knowledge transfer from one task to another so as to reduce the training effort of the latter.

The output of the attention mechanism allows direct observation of the information used by the agent to select its actions, enabling easier interpretation of this model than of traditional models. We analyze the different strategies the agents learn and show that a handful of strategies arise repeatedly across different games. We also show that the model learns to query separately about space and content (where'' vs.what'').

We propose a search method for neural network architectures that can already perform a task without any explicit weight training. To evaluate these networks, we populate the connections with a single shared weight parameter sampled from a uniform random distribution, and measure the expected performance. We demonstrate that our method can find minimal neural network architectures that can perform several reinforcement learning tasks without weight training. On a supervised learning domain, we find network architectures that achieve much higher than chance accuracy on MNIST using random weights.Interactive version of this paper at https://weightagnostic.github.io/",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/e98741479a7b998f88b8f8c9f0b6b6f1-Paper.pdf,2019,"network, architectures, neural, weight, learning, perform, without, find, method, much","weight, network, networks, inv, weights, neural, architectures, performance, search, lin","{'weight': 0.638873337422961, 'agnostic': 0.6236555839209136, 'networks': 0.3185079052192518, 'neural': 0.3185079052192518}","{'weight': 0.4280459327093737, 'architectures': 0.3714271523002616, 'network': 0.281494973527293, 'neural': 0.21816423504152688, 'perform': 0.20644523865798015, 'without': 0.17117386371300775, 'populate': 0.14394902681971752, 'weightagnostic': 0.14394902681971752, 'much': 0.13989006330666573, 'random': 0.1338065228264455}"
DeepWave: A Recurrent Neural-Network for Real-Time Acoustic Imaging,"Matthieu SIMEONI, Sepand Kashani, Paul Hurley, Martin Vetterli","We propose a recurrent neural-network for real-time reconstruction of acoustic camera spherical maps. The network, dubbed DeepWave, is both physically and algorithmically motivated: its recurrent architecture mimics iterative solvers from convex optimisation, and its parsimonious parametrisation is based on the natural structure of acoustic imaging problems.
Each network layer applies successive filtering, biasing and activation steps to its input, which can be interpreted as generalised deblurring and sparsification steps. To comply with the irregular geometry of spherical maps, filtering operations are implemented efficiently by means of graph signal processing techniques.
Unlike commonly-used imaging network architectures, DeepWave is moreover capable of directly processing the complex-valued raw microphone correlations, learning how to optimally back-project these into a spherical map. We propose moreover a smart physically-inspired initialisation scheme that attains much faster training and higher performance than random initialisation.
Our real-data experiments show DeepWave has similar computational speed to the state-of-the-art delay-and-sum imager with vastly superior resolution. While developed primarily for acoustic cameras, DeepWave could easily be adapted to neighbouring  signal processing fields, such as radio astronomy, radar and sonar.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/e9bf14a419d77534105016f5ec122d62-Paper.pdf,2019,"deepwave, network, acoustic, processing, spherical, filtering, imaging, initialisation, maps, moreover","deepwave, network, acoustic, sound, spherical, das, training, imaging, real, rn","{'acoustic': 0.45168936787533276, 'deepwave': 0.45168936787533276, 'imaging': 0.4103314198416257, 'real': 0.3861385711351327, 'recurrent': 0.30861437476556824, 'time': 0.2686281401669342, 'network': 0.26460412756947244, 'neural': 0.19250793578693803}","{'deepwave': 0.405694737418338, 'acoustic': 0.3042710530637535, 'spherical': 0.2674422516150194, 'initialisation': 0.202847368709169, 'physically': 0.1842740935105296, 'processing': 0.17489362457036697, 'filtering': 0.15269135866679823, 'imaging': 0.1455030716930533, 'network': 0.1322239220053488, 'maps': 0.12855426791461133}"
A Linearly Convergent Proximal Gradient Algorithm for Decentralized  Optimization,"Sulaiman Alghunaim, Kun Yuan, Ali H. Sayed","Decentralized optimization is a powerful  paradigm that finds applications in engineering and learning design.  This work studies decentralized composite optimization problems with  non-smooth regularization terms. Most existing gradient-based proximal decentralized methods are known to converge to the optimal solution with sublinear rates, and it remains unclear whether this family of methods can achieve global linear convergence. To tackle this problem, this work assumes the non-smooth regularization term is common across all networked agents, which is the case for many machine learning problems. Under this condition, we design a proximal gradient decentralized algorithm whose fixed point coincides with the desired minimizer. We then provide a concise proof that establishes its linear convergence.

Meta Architecture Search,"Albert Shaw, Wei Wei, Weiyang Liu, Le Song, Bo Dai","Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has been quite successful in constructing state-of-the-art models on a variety of tasks. Unfortunately, the computational cost can make it difficult to scale. In this paper, we make the first attempt to study Meta Architecture Search which aims at learning a task-agnostic representation that can be used to speed up the process of architecture search on a large number of tasks. We propose the Bayesian Meta Architecture SEarch (BASE) framework which takes advantage of a Bayesian formulation of the architecture search problem to learn over an entire set of tasks simultaneously. We show that on Imagenet classification, we can find a model that achieves 25.7% top-1 error and 8.1% top-5 error by adapting the architecture in less than an hour from an 8 GPU days pretrained meta-network. By learning a good prior for NAS, our method dramatically decreases the required computation cost while achieving comparable performance to current state-of-the-art methods - even finding competitive models for unseen datasets with very quick adaptation.

To address this shortcoming, we introduce ‘Graph Structured Prediction Energy Networks,’ for which we develop inference techniques that allow to both model explicit local and implicit higher-order correlations while maintaining tractability of inference.

Universal Invariant and Equivariant Graph Neural Networks,"Nicolas Keriven, Gabriel Peyré","Graph Neural Networks (GNN) come in many flavors, but should always be either invariant (permutation of the nodes of the input graph does not affect the output) or \emph{equivariant} (permutation of the input permutes the output). In this paper, we consider a specific class of invariant and equivariant networks, for which we prove new universality theorems. More precisely, we consider networks with a single hidden layer, obtained by summing channels formed by applying an equivariant linear operator, a pointwise non-linearity, and either an invariant or equivariant linear output layer. Recently, Maron et al. (2019) showed that by allowing higher-order tensorization inside the network, universal invariant GNNs can be obtained. As a first contribution, we propose an alternative proof of this result, which relies on the Stone-Weierstrass theorem for algebra of real-valued functions. Our main contribution is then an extension of this result to the \emph{equivariant} case, which appears in many practical applications but has been less studied from a theoretical point of view. The proof relies on a new generalized Stone-Weierstrass theorem for algebra of equivariant functions, which is of independent interest. Additionally, unlike many previous works that consider a fixed number of nodes, our results show that a GNN defined by a single set of parameters can approximate uniformly well a function defined on graphs of varying size.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/ea9268cb43f55d1d12380fb6ea5bf572-Paper.pdf,2019,"equivariant, invariant, consider, many, networks, output, algebra, contribution, defined, either","equivariant, invariant, al, et, theorem, functions, proof, graphs, case, nodes","{'equivariant': 0.5256425390833599, 'invariant': 0.5256425390833599, 'universal': 0.4726622023007022, 'graph': 0.31993880272132447, 'networks': 0.24660641439497524, 'neural': 0.24660641439497524}","{'equivariant': 0.47972053217609223, 'invariant': 0.26457119587276023, 'stone': 0.19220540855538087, 'weierstrass': 0.19220540855538087, 'algebra': 0.17361058744599228, 'gnn': 0.15990684405869743, 'permutation': 0.15734999063265684, 'output': 0.15280818149726128, 'proof': 0.14413849327999323, 'theorem': 0.1375626773712639}"
A Primal-Dual link between GANs and Autoencoders,"Hisham Husain, Richard Nock, Robert C. Williamson","Since the introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAE), the literature on generative modelling has witnessed an overwhelming resurgence. The impressive, yet elusive empirical performance of GANs has lead to the rise of many GAN-VAE hybrids, with the hopes of GAN level performance and additional benefits of VAE, such as an encoder for feature reduction, which is not offered by GANs. Recently, the Wasserstein Autoencoder (WAE) was proposed, achieving performance similar to that of GANs, yet it is still unclear whether the two are fundamentally different or can be further improved into a unified model. In this work, we study the $f$-GAN and WAE models and make two main discoveries. First, we find that the $f$-GAN and WAE objectives partake in a primal-dual relationship and are equivalent under some assumptions, which then allows us to explicate the success of WAE. Second, the equivalence result allows us to, for the first time, prove generalization bounds for Autoencoder models, which is a pertinent problem when it comes to theoretical analyses of generative models. Furthermore, we show that the WAE objective is related to other statistical quantities such as the $f$-divergence and in particular, upper bounded by the Wasserstein distance, which then allows us to tap into existing efficient (regularized) optimal transport solvers. Our findings thus present the first primal-dual relationship between GANs and Autoencoder models, comment on generalization abilities and make a step towards unifying these models.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/eae27d77ca20db309e056e3d2dcd7d69-Paper.pdf,2019,"gans, models, wae, gan, allows, autoencoder, first, generative, performance, us","px, pg, wae, objective, wasserstein, pz, df, wc, adversarial, theorem","{'link': 0.5211240061898645, 'primal': 0.45804744218259413, 'dual': 0.42569284885048597, 'autoencoders': 0.4175847790762182, 'gans': 0.4037708033080553}","{'wae': 0.486400439250492, 'gans': 0.314580659669075, 'gan': 0.24823647678714214, 'vae': 0.21682292605838874, 'autoencoder': 0.1929581688699456, 'us': 0.1455192766387257, 'primal': 0.1427754414533933, 'models': 0.14058263276485786, 'generative': 0.12889038955693619, 'dual': 0.12863877924663042}"
Transfusion: Understanding Transfer Learning for Medical Imaging,"Maithra Raghu, Chiyuan Zhang, Jon Kleinberg, Samy Bengio","Transfer learning from natural image datasets, particularly ImageNet, using standard large models and corresponding pretrained weights has become a de-facto method for deep learning applications to medical imaging. 
However, there are fundamental differences in data sizes, features and task specifications between natural image classification and the target medical tasks, and there is little understanding of the effects of transfer. In this paper, we explore properties of transfer learning for medical imaging. A performance evaluation on two large scale medical imaging tasks shows that surprisingly, transfer offers little benefit to performance, and simple, lightweight models can perform comparably to ImageNet architectures. Investigating the learned representations and features, we find that some of the differences from transfer learning are due to the over-parametrization of standard models rather than sophisticated feature reuse. We isolate where useful feature reuse occurs, and outline the implications for more efficient model exploration.

The Randomized Midpoint Method for Log-Concave Sampling,"Ruoqi Shen, Yin Tat Lee","Sampling from log-concave distributions is a well researched problem
that has many applications in statistics and machine learning. We
study the distributions of the form $p^{*}\propto\exp(-f(x))$, where
$f:\mathbb{R}^{d}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ has an $L$-Lipschitz gradient
and is $m$-strongly convex. In our paper, we propose a Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm based on the underdamped Langevin diffusion
(ULD). It can achieve $\epsilon\cdot D$ error (in 2-Wasserstein distance)
in $\tilde{O}\left(\kappa^{7/6}/\epsilon^{1/3}+\kappa/\epsilon^{2/3}\right)$
steps, where $D\overset{\mathrm{def}}{=}\sqrt{\frac{d}{m}}$ is the effective diameter
of the problem and $\kappa\overset{\mathrm{def}}{=}\frac{L}{m}$ is the condition number. Our algorithm performs significantly faster than the previously best
known algorithm for solving this problem, which requires $\tilde{O}\left(\kappa^{1.5}/\epsilon\right)$
steps \cite{chen2019optimal,dalalyan2018sampling}. Moreover, our
algorithm can be easily parallelized to require only $O(\kappa\log\frac{1}{\epsilon})$
parallel steps. 

To solve the sampling problem, we propose a new framework to discretize
stochastic differential equations. We apply this framework to discretize
and simulate ULD, which converges to the target distribution $p^{*}$.

The task is designed to answer the question: given an audio clip spoken by an unseen person, can we picture a face that has as many common elements, or associations as possible with the speaker, in terms of identity?To address this problem, we propose a simple but effective computational framework based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). The network learns to generate faces from voices by matching the identities of generated faces to those of the speakers, on a training set. We evaluate the performance of the network by leveraging a closely related task - cross-modal matching. The results show that our model is able to generate faces that match several biometric characteristics of the speaker, and results in matching accuracies that are much better than chance.

Using a Logarithmic Mapping to Enable Lower Discount Factors in Reinforcement Learning,"Harm Van Seijen, Mehdi Fatemi, Arash Tavakoli","In an effort to better understand the different ways in which the discount factor affects the optimization process in reinforcement learning, we designed a set of experiments to study each effect in isolation. Our analysis reveals that the common perception that poor performance of low discount factors is caused by (too) small action-gaps requires revision. We propose an alternative hypothesis that identifies the size-difference of the action-gap across the state-space as the primary cause. We then introduce a new method that enables more homogeneous action-gaps by mapping value estimates to a logarithmic space. We prove convergence for this method under standard assumptions and demonstrate empirically that it indeed enables lower discount factors for approximate reinforcement-learning methods.

PRNet is self-supervised, jointly learning an appropriate geometric representation,  a keypoint detector that finds points in common between partial views, and keypoint-to-keypoint correspondences.

In this work, we target our attack on the wake-word detection system. Our goal is to jam the model with some inconspicuous background music to deactivate the VAs while our audio adversary is present. We implemented an emulated wake-word detection system of Amazon Alexa based on recent publications. We validated our models against the real Alexa in terms of wake-word detection accuracy. Then we computed our audio adversaries with consideration of expectation over transform and we implemented our audio adversary with a differentiable synthesizer. Next we verified our audio adversaries digitally on hundreds of samples of utterances collected from the real world. Our experiments show that we can effectively reduce the recognition F1 score of our emulated model from 93.4% to 11.0%. Finally, we tested our audio adversary over the air, and verified it works effectively against Alexa, reducing its F1 score from 92.5% to 11.0%.

Learning to Optimize in Swarms,"Yue Cao, Tianlong Chen, Zhangyang Wang, Yang Shen","Learning to optimize has emerged as a powerful framework for various optimization and machine learning tasks. Current such ""meta-optimizers"" often learn in the space of continuous optimization algorithms that are point-based and uncertainty-unaware. To overcome the limitations, we propose a meta-optimizer that learns in the algorithmic space of both point-based and population-based optimization algorithms. The meta-optimizer targets at a meta-loss function consisting of both cumulative regret and entropy. Specifically, we learn and interpret the update formula through a population of LSTMs embedded with sample- and feature-level attentions. Meanwhile, we estimate the posterior directly over the global optimum and use an uncertainty measure to help guide the learning process. Empirical results over non-convex test functions and the protein-docking application demonstrate that this new meta-optimizer outperforms existing competitors.

A Little Is Enough: Circumventing Defenses For Distributed Learning,"Gilad Baruch, Moran Baruch, Yoav Goldberg","Distributed learning is central for large-scale training of deep-learning models. However, it is exposed to a security threat in which Byzantine participants can interrupt or control the learning process. Previous attack models assume that the rogue participants (a) are omniscient (know the data of all other participants), and (b) introduce large changes to the parameters. 
Accordingly, most defense mechanisms make a similar assumption and attempt to use statistically robust methods to identify and discard values whose reported gradients are far from the population mean. We observe that if the empirical variance between the gradients of workers is high enough, an attacker could take advantage of this and launch a non-omniscient attack that operates within the population variance. We show that the variance is indeed high enough even for simple datasets such as MNIST, allowing an attack that is not only undetected by existing defenses, but also uses their power against them, causing those defense mechanisms to consistently select the byzantine workers while discarding legitimate ones. We demonstrate our attack method works not only for preventing convergence but also for repurposing of the model behavior (``backdooring''). We show that less than 25\% of colluding workers are sufficient to degrade the accuracy of  models trained on MNIST, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 by 50\%, as well as to introduce backdoors without hurting the accuracy for MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets, but with a degradation for CIFAR100.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/ec1c59141046cd1866bbbcdfb6ae31d4-Paper.pdf,2019,"attack, learning, mnist, models, participants, variance, workers, accuracy, also, byzantine","workers, parameters, attack, attacker, defense, defenses, mean, corrupted, byzantine, backdoor","{'circumventing': 0.47521725253928293, 'defenses': 0.47521725253928293, 'enough': 0.47521725253928293, 'little': 0.4317050252586415, 'distributed': 0.3372867554139375, 'learning': 0.1495797595125107}","{'attack': 0.2888744057299307, 'participants': 0.2612750097912319, 'workers': 0.2612750097912319, 'omniscient': 0.2132314886776099, 'byzantine': 0.20181063728740964, 'mnist': 0.1932747644479487, 'cifar100': 0.1874220661904821, 'variance': 0.18059506692273924, 'defense': 0.17418333986082127, 'cifar10': 0.1564771403918875}"

We first prove that the gap between LfD and LfO actually lies in the disagreement of inverse dynamics models between the imitator and expert, if following the modeling approach of GAIL. More importantly, the upper bound of this gap is revealed by a negative causal entropy which can be minimized in a model-free way.

A Meta-Analysis of Overfitting in Machine Learning,"Rebecca Roelofs, Vaishaal Shankar, Benjamin Recht, Sara Fridovich-Keil, Moritz Hardt, John Miller, Ludwig Schmidt","We conduct the first large meta-analysis of overfitting due to test set reuse in the machine learning community. Our analysis is based on over one hundred machine learning competitions hosted on the Kaggle platform over the course of several years. In each competition, numerous practitioners repeatedly evaluated their progress against a holdout set that forms the basis of a public ranking available throughout the competition. Performance on a separate test set used only once determined the final ranking.

Projected Stein Variational Newton: A Fast and Scalable Bayesian Inference Method in High Dimensions,"Peng Chen, Keyi Wu, Joshua Chen, Tom O'Leary-Roseberry, Omar Ghattas","We propose a projected Stein variational Newton (pSVN) method for high-dimensional Bayesian inference.

From deep learning to mechanistic understanding in neuroscience: the structure of retinal prediction,"Hidenori Tanaka, Aran Nayebi, Niru Maheswaranathan, Lane McIntosh, Stephen Baccus, Surya Ganguli","Recently, deep feedforward neural networks have achieved considerable success in modeling biological sensory processing, in terms of reproducing the input-output map of sensory neurons. However, such models raise profound questions about the very nature of explanation in neuroscience. Are we simply replacing one complex system (a biological circuit) with another (a deep network), without understanding either? Moreover, beyond neural representations, are the deep network's computational mechanisms for generating neural responses the same as those in the brain? Without a systematic approach to extracting and understanding computational mechanisms from deep neural network models, it can be difficult both to assess the degree of utility of deep learning approaches in neuroscience, and to extract experimentally testable hypotheses from deep networks. We develop such a systematic approach by combining dimensionality reduction and modern attribution methods for determining the relative importance of interneurons for specific visual computations. We apply this approach to deep network models of the retina, revealing a conceptual understanding of how the retina acts as a predictive feature extractor that signals deviations from expectations for diverse spatiotemporal stimuli. For each stimulus, our extracted computational mechanisms are consistent with prior scientific literature, and in one case yields a new mechanistic hypothesis. Thus overall, this work not only yields insights into the computational mechanisms underlying the striking predictive capabilities of the retina, but also places the framework of deep networks as neuroscientific models on firmer theoretical foundations, by providing a new roadmap to go beyond comparing neural representations to extracting and understand computational mechanisms.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/eeaebbffb5d29ff62799637fc51adb7b-Paper.pdf,2019,"deep, computational, mechanisms, neural, models, network, approach, networks, retina, understanding","model, cell, deep, response, motion, models, stimuli, stimulus, responses, retina","{'neuroscience': 0.4640233712933662, 'retinal': 0.4640233712933662, 'mechanistic': 0.43916990336521333, 'understanding': 0.34474648528394963, 'structure': 0.31431679359007664, 'prediction': 0.3001082368845489, 'deep': 0.21783437846190876, 'learning': 0.14605636456876878}","{'mechanisms': 0.32860545456028933, 'deep': 0.27139143121521203, 'retina': 0.26006840758865996, 'computational': 0.23389214975672454, 'extracting': 0.15806311534038628, 'biological': 0.15531776041683235, 'systematic': 0.15531776041683235, 'understanding': 0.15170133973501412, 'neural': 0.14947610886056356, 'sensory': 0.14848139462341056}"
Abstract Reasoning with Distracting Features,"Kecheng Zheng, Zheng-Jun Zha, Wei Wei","Abstraction reasoning is a long-standing challenge in artificial intelligence. Recent studies suggest that many of the deep architectures that have triumphed over other domains failed to work well in abstract reasoning. In this paper, we first illustrate that one of the main challenges in such a reasoning task is the presence of distracting features, which requires the learning algorithm to leverage counter-evidence and to reject any of false hypothesis in order to learn the true patterns. We later show that carefully designed learning trajectory over different categories of training data can effectively boost learning performance by mitigating the impacts of distracting features. Inspired this fact, we propose feature robust abstract reasoning (FRAR) model, which consists of a reinforcement learning based teacher network to determine the sequence of training and a student network for predictions.

Prior-Free Dynamic Auctions with Low Regret Buyers,"Yuan Deng, Jon Schneider, Balasubramanian Sivan","We study the problem of how to repeatedly sell to a buyer running a no-regret, mean-based algorithm. Previous work [Braverman et al., 2018] shows that it is possible to design effective mechanisms in such a setting that extract almost all of the economic surplus, but these mechanisms require the buyer's values each round to be drawn independently and identically from a fixed distribution. In this work, we do away with this assumption and consider the prior-free setting where the buyer's value each round is chosen adversarially (possibly adaptively). 

We show that even in this prior-free setting, it is possible to extract a $(1-\varepsilon)$-approximation of the full economic surplus for any $\varepsilon > 0$. The number of options offered to a buyer in any round scales independently of the number of rounds $T$ and polynomially in $\varepsilon$. We show that this is optimal up to a polynomial factor; any mechanism achieving this approximation factor, even when values are drawn stochastically, requires at least $\Omega(1/\varepsilon)$ options.

Finally, we examine what is possible when we constrain our mechanism to a natural auction format where overbidding is dominated. Braverman et al. [2018] show that even when values are drawn from a known stochastic distribution supported on $[1/H, 1]$, it is impossible in general to extract more than $O(\log\log H / \log H)$ of the economic surplus. We show how to achieve the same approximation factor in the prior-independent setting (where the distribution is unknown to the seller), and an approximation factor of $O(1 / \log H)$ in the prior-free setting (where the values are chosen adversarially).",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/f15eda31a2da646eea513b0f81a5414d-Paper.pdf,2019,"setting, approximation, buyer, factor, log, prior, show, values, varepsilon, distribution","buyer, option, revenue, κi, mechanism, log, based, vt, al, et","{'buyers': 0.4741441241339658, 'auctions': 0.4053346118515247, 'prior': 0.38731618687850033, 'free': 0.3733400106666746, 'dynamic': 0.3439022182507676, 'regret': 0.3239564683726595, 'low': 0.3134933503017723}","{'buyer': 0.31925114064161336, 'varepsilon': 0.2645346911865698, 'economic': 0.26357172325277933, 'surplus': 0.26357172325277933, 'factor': 0.1967387452137323, 'values': 0.19276856760048758, 'round': 0.18906084702383058, 'extract': 0.183402410828154, 'setting': 0.18251906636259554, 'braverman': 0.17571448216851956}"
When does label smoothing help?,"Rafael Müller, Simon Kornblith, Geoffrey E. Hinton","The generalization and learning speed of a multi-class neural network can often be significantly improved by using soft targets that are a weighted average of the hard targets and the uniform distribution over labels. Smoothing the labels in this way prevents the network from becoming over-confident and label smoothing has been used in many state-of-the-art models, including image classification, language translation and speech recognition. Despite its widespread use, label smoothing is still poorly understood. Here we show empirically that in addition to improving generalization, label smoothing improves model calibration which can significantly improve beam search. However, we also observe that if a teacher network is trained with label smoothing, knowledge distillation into a student network is much less effective.  To explain these observations, we visualize how label smoothing changes the  representations learned by the penultimate layer of the network. We show that label smoothing encourages the representations of training examples from the same class to group in tight clusters. This results in loss of information in the logits about resemblances between instances of different classes, which is necessary for distillation, but does not hurt generalization or calibration of the model's predictions.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/f1748d6b0fd9d439f71450117eba2725-Paper.pdf,2019,"smoothing, label, network, generalization, calibration, class, distillation, labels, model, representations","label, smoothing, trained, network, targets, information, teacher, training, classes, calibration","{'help': 0.6352062468253656, 'smoothing': 0.6011840853139024, 'label': 0.48486154679384413}","{'smoothing': 0.5956533840174085, 'label': 0.3856242159981095, 'targets': 0.18037019508777605, 'network': 0.17610921285100367, 'distillation': 0.170186681147831, 'calibration': 0.15861014724560635, 'generalization': 0.14780174420432204, 'labels': 0.1190297164044744, 'beam': 0.10806906916835811, 'logits': 0.10806906916835811}"
A General Framework for Symmetric Property Estimation,"Moses Charikar, Kirankumar Shiragur, Aaron Sidford",In this paper we provide a general framework for estimating symmetric properties of distributions from i.i.d. samples. For a broad class of symmetric properties we identify the  {\em easy} region where empirical estimation works and the {\em difficult} region where more complex estimators are required. We show that by approximately computing the profile maximum likelihood (PML) distribution \cite{ADOS16} in this difficult region we obtain a symmetric property estimation framework that is sample complexity optimal for many properties in a broader parameter regime than previous universal estimation approaches based on PML. The resulting algorithms based on these \emph{pseudo PML distributions} are also more practical.,https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/f19fec2f129fbdba76493451275c883a-Paper.pdf,2019,"estimation, pml, properties, region, symmetric, based, difficult, distributions, em, framework","φs, pml, distribution, fs, estimator, sample, entropy, pβ, log, estimating","{'property': 0.5330030243879169, 'symmetric': 0.4950013015136123, 'general': 0.46003643906830954, 'framework': 0.37527078940496744, 'estimation': 0.344121776180883}","{'pml': 0.46369898100876517, 'symmetric': 0.3640017057352457, 'region': 0.3125540133791985, 'estimation': 0.23298414868586334, 'properties': 0.21638081592428499, 'em': 0.20978410915684623, 'difficult': 0.17987721713172977, 'ados16': 0.1633135321768266, 'distributions': 0.1518066245661672, 'profile': 0.14836008616426835}"
Deep Generative Video Compression,"Salvator Lombardo, JUN HAN, Christopher Schroers, Stephan Mandt","The usage of deep generative models for image compression has led to impressive
performance gains over classical codecs while neural video compression is still in its infancy. Here, we propose an end-to-end, deep generative modeling approach to compress temporal sequences with a focus on video. Our approach builds upon variational autoencoder (VAE) models for sequential data and combines them with recent work on neural image compression. The approach jointly learns to transform the original sequence into a lower-dimensional representation as well as to discretize and entropy code this representation according to predictions of the sequential VAE.

CondConv: Conditionally Parameterized Convolutions for Efficient Inference,"Brandon Yang, Gabriel Bender, Quoc V. Le, Jiquan Ngiam","Convolutional layers are one of the basic building blocks of modern deep neural networks. One fundamental assumption is that convolutional kernels should
be shared for all examples in a dataset. We propose conditionally parameterized convolutions (CondConv), which learn specialized convolutional kernels
for each example. Replacing normal convolutions with CondConv enables us to increase the size and capacity of a network, while maintaining efficient inference. We demonstrate that scaling networks with CondConv improves the performance and inference cost trade-off of several existing convolutional neural
network architectures on both classification and detection tasks.

Towards a Zero-One Law for Column Subset Selection,"Zhao Song, David Woodruff, Peilin Zhong","There are a number of approximation algorithms for NP-hard versions of low rank approximation, such as finding a rank-$k$ matrix $B$ minimizing the sum of absolute values of differences to a given $n$-by-$n$ matrix $A$, $\min_{\textrm{rank-}k~B}\|A-B\|_1$, or more generally finding a rank-$k$ matrix $B$ which minimizes the sum of $p$-th powers of absolute values of differences, $\min_{\textrm{rank-}k~B}\|A-B\|_p^p$. Many of these algorithms are linear time columns subset selection algorithms, 
returning a subset of $\poly(k \log n)$ columns whose cost is no more than a $\poly(k)$ factor larger than the cost of the best rank-$k$ matrix. 
The above error measures are special cases of the following general entrywise
low rank approximation problem: given an arbitrary function $g:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$, find a rank-$k$ matrix $B$ which minimizes $\|A-B\|_g = \sum_{i,j}g(A_{i,j}-B_{i,j})$. A natural question is which functions $g$ admit efficient approximation algorithms? Indeed, this is a central question of recent work studying generalized low rank models. In this work we give approximation algorithms for {\it every} function $g$ which is approximately monotone and satisfies an approximate triangle inequality, and we show both of these conditions are necessary. Further, our algorithm is efficient if the function $g$ admits an efficient approximate regression algorithm. Our approximation algorithms handle functions which are not even scale-invariant, such as the Huber loss function, which we show have very different structural properties than $\ell_p$-norms, e.g., one can show the lack of scale-invariance causes any column subset selection algorithm to provably require a $\sqrt{\log n}$ factor larger number of columns than $\ell_p$-norms; nevertheless we design the first efficient column subset selection algorithms for such error measures.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/f24ad6f72d6cc4cb51464f2b29ab69d3-Paper.pdf,2019,"rank, algorithms, approximation, matrix, efficient, function, subset, algorithm, columns, low","rank, approximation, columns, matrix, log, low, ti, function, loss, subset","{'law': 0.45492610909778614, 'column': 0.4305598979075464, 'subset': 0.38890558475037745, 'selection': 0.35248017426642525, 'one': 0.33798766803107905, 'zero': 0.3338415779146795, 'towards': 0.3263199650472219}","{'rank': 0.44386538774636686, 'approximation': 0.2399518577681725, 'matrix': 0.21105608604246023, 'columns': 0.2053092627012535, 'subset': 0.1991540732925841, 'algorithms': 0.19556982677389798, 'textrm': 0.161661431017853, 'min_': 0.15517030326271666, 'selection': 0.14283666877272463, 'ell_p': 0.14254338653369816}"
Neural Attribution for Semantic Bug-Localization in Student Programs,"Rahul Gupta, Aditya Kanade, Shirish Shevade","Providing feedback is an integral part of teaching. Most open online courses on programming make use of automated grading systems to support programming assignments and give real-time feedback. These systems usually rely on test results to quantify the programs' functional correctness. They return failing tests to the students as feedback. However, students may find it difficult to debug their programs if they receive no hints about where the bug is and how to fix it. In this work, we present NeuralBugLocator, a deep learning based technique, that can localize the bugs in a faulty program with respect to a failing test, without even running the program. At the heart of our technique is a novel tree convolutional neural network which is trained to predict whether a program passes or fails a given test. To localize the bugs, we analyze the trained network using a state-of-the-art neural prediction attribution technique and see which lines of the programs make it predict the test outcomes. Our experiments show that NeuralBugLocator is generally more accurate than two state-of-the-art program-spectrum based and one syntactic difference based bug-localization baselines.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/f29a179746902e331572c483c45e5086-Paper.pdf,2019,"program, test, based, feedback, programs, technique, art, bug, bugs, failing","program, programs, buggy, test, bug, technique, localization, input, network, lines","{'bug': 0.44524299340794604, 'programs': 0.42139541774369554, 'student': 0.42139541774369554, 'attribution': 0.3913510255866578, 'localization': 0.3913510255866578, 'semantic': 0.322939893799763, 'neural': 0.18976052057133624}","{'program': 0.3125341385198004, 'programs': 0.24163246553959458, 'neuralbuglocator': 0.22457491450908795, 'students': 0.22457491450908795, 'feedback': 0.2163579821798851, 'test': 0.21414907801616645, 'bug': 0.21254650003577785, 'bugs': 0.21254650003577785, 'failing': 0.20401220414990906, 'localize': 0.20401220414990906}"
Theoretical Limits of Pipeline Parallel Optimization and Application to Distributed Deep Learning,"Igor Colin, Ludovic DOS SANTOS, Kevin Scaman","We investigate the theoretical limits of pipeline parallel learning of deep learning architectures, a distributed setup in which the computation is distributed per layer instead of per example. For smooth convex and non-convex objective functions, we provide matching lower and upper complexity bounds and show that a naive pipeline parallelization of Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent is optimal. For non-smooth convex functions, we provide a novel algorithm coined Pipeline Parallel Random Smoothing (PPRS) that is within a $d^{1/4}$ multiplicative factor of the optimal convergence rate, where $d$ is the underlying dimension. While the convergence rate still obeys a slow $\varepsilon^{-2}$ convergence rate, the depth-dependent part is accelerated, resulting in a near-linear speed-up and convergence time that only slightly depends on the depth of the deep learning architecture. Finally, we perform an empirical analysis of the non-smooth non-convex case and show that, for difficult and highly non-smooth problems, PPRS outperforms more traditional optimization algorithms such as gradient descent and Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent for problems where the sample size is limited, such as few-shot or adversarial learning.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/f29e2360ef277f77595dfae0aab78138-Paper.pdf,2019,"non, convergence, convex, learning, smooth, accelerated, descent, gradient, pipeline, rate","non, smooth, convergence, convex, function, optimization, pipeline, gradient, objective, parallel","{'pipeline': 0.42467525572020054, 'application': 0.39439701968582475, 'limits': 0.39439701968582475, 'theoretical': 0.38359024948102566, 'parallel': 0.3744532554628725, 'distributed': 0.31847205525003874, 'optimization': 0.23548446933020412, 'deep': 0.21064483169064466, 'learning': 0.14123582581027533}","{'pipeline': 0.31983075435251435, 'smooth': 0.27582076431088215, 'accelerated': 0.26032934721228945, 'pprs': 0.24941676738119567, 'non': 0.22388916445825524, 'convex': 0.22376429109998394, 'convergence': 0.21091086772376696, 'nesterov': 0.1903832026734057, 'rate': 0.17303022874593366, 'descent': 0.17219256649438516}"
DppNet: Approximating Determinantal Point Processes with Deep Networks,"Zelda E. Mariet, Yaniv Ovadia, Jasper Snoek","Determinantal point processes (DPPs) provide an elegant and versatile way to sample sets of items that balance the point-wise quality with the set-wise diversity of selected items. For this reason, they have gained prominence in many machine learning applications that rely on subset selection. However, sampling from a DPP over a ground set of size N is a costly operation, requiring in general an O(N^3) preprocessing cost and an O(Nk^3) sampling cost for subsets of size k. We approach this problem by introducing DppNets: generative deep models that produce DPP-like samples for arbitrary ground sets.  We develop an inhibitive attention mechanism based on transformer networks that captures a notion of dissimilarity between feature vectors.  We show theoretically that such an approximation is sensible as it maintains the guarantees of inhibition or dissimilarity that makes DPPs so powerful and unique. Empirically, we show across multiple datasets that DPPNET is orders of magnitude faster than competing approaches for DPP sampling, while generating high-likelihood samples and performing as well as DPPs on downstream tasks.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/f2d887e01a80e813d9080038decbbabb-Paper.pdf,2019,"dpp, dpps, sampling, cost, dissimilarity, ground, items, point, samples, set","dppnet, dpp, sampling, set, dpps, kernel, size, samples, feature, ground","{'dppnet': 0.5115200007318853, 'approximating': 0.46468379179479546, 'determinantal': 0.4372863658906568, 'point': 0.3436139480164771, 'processes': 0.3285360565016133, 'deep': 0.24013152854712327, 'networks': 0.2180074769477564}","{'dpp': 0.34623266124101715, 'dpps': 0.34623266124101715, 'dissimilarity': 0.2308217741606781, 'items': 0.182731583017331, 'sampling': 0.18218127122724226, 'wise': 0.16234141635473368, 'ground': 0.1613909530600741, 'sets': 0.14348353777704018, 'dppnet': 0.13130383077056254, 'dppnets': 0.13130383077056254}"

Deep Learning without Weight Transport,"Mohamed Akrout, Collin Wilson, Peter Humphreys, Timothy Lillicrap, Douglas B. Tweed","Current algorithms for deep learning probably cannot run in the brain because
they rely on weight transport, where forward-path neurons transmit their synaptic
weights to a feedback path, in a way that is likely impossible biologically. An algorithm called feedback alignment achieves deep learning without weight transport by using random feedback weights, but it performs poorly on hard visual-recognition tasks. Here we describe two mechanisms — a neural circuit called a weight mirror and a modification of an algorithm proposed by Kolen and Pollack in 1994 — both of which let the feedback path learn appropriate synaptic weights quickly and accurately even in large networks, without weight transport or complex wiring. Tested on the ImageNet visual-recognition task, these mechanisms outperform both feedback alignment and the newer sign-symmetry method, and nearly match backprop, the standard algorithm of deep learning, which uses weight transport.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/f387624df552cea2f369918c5e1e12bc-Paper.pdf,2019,"feedback, weight, transport, algorithm, deep, learning, path, weights, alignment, called","feedback, weight, yl, bl, forward, wl, path, learning, δl, layer","{'weight': 0.5722012676042524, 'without': 0.5467650839960948, 'transport': 0.4801183242571434, 'deep': 0.3142187265467324, 'learning': 0.21068136812421887}","{'feedback': 0.38418289991677046, 'weight': 0.35573717124666626, 'transport': 0.3117075145954947, 'path': 0.25216428480257425, 'synaptic': 0.2045412560567622, 'weights': 0.19686455436104647, 'alignment': 0.16347595544820803, 'mechanisms': 0.15943563790924448, 'recognition': 0.1506607744952399, 'visual': 0.12972565085048596}"
Implicit Regularization of Discrete Gradient Dynamics in Linear Neural Networks,"Gauthier Gidel, Francis Bach, Simon Lacoste-Julien","When optimizing over-parameterized models, such as deep neural networks, a large set of parameters can achieve zero training error. In such cases, the choice of the optimization algorithm and its respective hyper-parameters introduces biases that will lead to convergence to specific minimizers of the objective. Consequently, this choice can be considered as an implicit regularization for the training of over-parametrized models. In this work, we push this idea further by studying the discrete gradient dynamics of the training of a two-layer linear network with the least-squares loss. Using a time rescaling, we show that, with a vanishing initialization and a small enough step size, this dynamics sequentially learns the solutions of a reduced-rank regression with a gradually increasing rank.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/f39ae9ff3a81f499230c4126e01f421b-Paper.pdf,2019,"training, choice, dynamics, models, parameters, rank, achieve, algorithm, biases, cases","linear, dynamics, gradient, σi, al, et, w1, solution, time, continuous","{'discrete': 0.45219930507715633, 'implicit': 0.4062320437890961, 'dynamics': 0.38894601922680555, 'regularization': 0.38894601922680555, 'linear': 0.33825935259838336, 'gradient': 0.31966837887843513, 'networks': 0.23593011811431527, 'neural': 0.23593011811431527}","{'choice': 0.24927164287967024, 'rank': 0.2342211693712111, 'dynamics': 0.20164569684603798, 'training': 0.19401000705038168, 'rescaling': 0.19193925351291008, 'minimizers': 0.18423239227870383, 'push': 0.17825448628466647, 'parametrized': 0.1692405605481667, 'respective': 0.1692405605481667, 'parameters': 0.16788614561307544}"

Spike-Train Level Backpropagation for Training Deep Recurrent Spiking Neural Networks,"Wenrui Zhang, Peng Li","Spiking neural networks (SNNs) well support spatiotemporal learning and energy-efficient event-driven hardware neuromorphic processors. As an important class of SNNs,  recurrent spiking neural networks (RSNNs) possess great computational power. However, the practical application of RSNNs is severely limited by challenges in training.  Biologically-inspired unsupervised learning has limited capability in boosting the performance of RSNNs. On the other hand,  existing backpropagation (BP) methods suffer from high complexity of unrolling in time, vanishing and exploding gradients, and approximate differentiation of discontinuous spiking activities when applied to RSNNs.  To enable supervised training of RSNNs under a well-defined loss function,  we present a novel Spike-Train level RSNNs Backpropagation (ST-RSBP) algorithm for training deep RSNNs. The proposed ST-RSBP directly computes the gradient of a rated-coded loss function defined at the output layer of the network w.r.t tunable parameters. The scalability of ST-RSBP is achieved by the proposed spike-train level computation during which temporal effects of the SNN is captured in both the forward and backward pass of BP. Our ST-RSBP algorithm can be broadly applied to RSNNs with a single recurrent layer or deep RSNNs with multiple feed-forward and recurrent layers.  Based upon challenging speech and image datasets including TI46, N-TIDIGITS, Fashion-MNIST and MNIST,  ST-RSBP is able to train RSNNs with an accuracy surpassing that of the current state-of-art SNN BP algorithms and conventional non-spiking deep learning models.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/f42a37d114a480b6b57b60ea9a14a9d2-Paper.pdf,2019,"rsnns, rsbp, st, spiking, bp, deep, learning, recurrent, train, training","layer, rsbp, st, bp, ak, recurrent, spike, spiking, training, time","{'spike': 0.40378284213094773, 'spiking': 0.40378284213094773, 'backpropagation': 0.38756990873612596, 'level': 0.3647190625375547, 'train': 0.3647190625375547, 'recurrent': 0.29149521406065665, 'training': 0.2578028418123459, 'deep': 0.20028190405395882, 'networks': 0.18182932014497127, 'neural': 0.18182932014497127}","{'rsnns': 0.6510072801722037, 'rsbp': 0.32550364008610183, 'st': 0.32550364008610183, 'spiking': 0.2173097465016443, 'bp': 0.18484164075166123, 'snn': 0.13020145603444072, 'snns': 0.13020145603444072, 'recurrent': 0.11027330349660001, 'spike': 0.10433245371109391, 'train': 0.10045776564601208}"
Fully Parameterized Quantile Function for Distributional Reinforcement Learning,"Derek Yang, Li Zhao, Zichuan Lin, Tao Qin, Jiang Bian, Tie-Yan Liu","Distributional Reinforcement Learning (RL) differs from traditional RL in that, rather than the expectation of total returns, it estimates distributions and has achieved state-of-the-art performance on Atari Games. The key challenge in practical distributional RL algorithms lies in how to parameterize estimated distributions so as to better approximate the true continuous distribution. Existing distributional RL algorithms parameterize either the probability side or the return value side of the distribution function, leaving the other side uniformly fixed as in C51, QR-DQN or randomly sampled as in IQN. In this paper, we propose fully parameterized quantile function that parameterizes both the quantile fraction axis (i.e., the x-axis) and the value axis (i.e., y-axis) for distributional RL. Our algorithm contains a fraction proposal network that generates a discrete set of quantile fractions and a quantile value network that gives corresponding quantile values. The two networks are jointly trained to find the best approximation of the true distribution. Experiments on 55 Atari Games show that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing distributional RL algorithms and creates a new record for the Atari Learning Environment for non-distributed agents.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/f471223d1a1614b58a7dc45c9d01df19-Paper.pdf,2019,"rl, distributional, quantile, axis, algorithms, atari, distribution, side, value, algorithm","quantile, τi, al, et, network, function, iqn, value, distribution, distributional","{'quantile': 0.4555508513990746, 'distributional': 0.44076930222911276, 'fully': 0.44076930222911276, 'parameterized': 0.4184805966821612, 'function': 0.3597035640127216, 'reinforcement': 0.2729313171441164, 'learning': 0.15784200509866333}","{'quantile': 0.39435577390120097, 'axis': 0.35765929441981725, 'rl': 0.35305425268816865, 'distributional': 0.34577957685977145, 'atari': 0.21937941094333407, 'side': 0.20356390770626293, 'parameterize': 0.15026145747707542, 'value': 0.14723504460643083, 'fraction': 0.14625294062888938, 'games': 0.12028730983578949}"
Neural Taskonomy: Inferring the Similarity of Task-Derived Representations from Brain Activity,"Aria Wang, Michael Tarr, Leila Wehbe","Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained for object classification have been widely used to account for visually-driven neural responses in both human and primate brains. However, because of the generality and complexity of object classification, despite the effectiveness of CNNs in predicting brain activity, it is difficult to draw specific inferences about neural information processing using CNN-derived representations. To address this problem, we used learned representations drawn from 21 computer vision tasks to construct encoding models for predicting brain responses from BOLD5000---a large-scale dataset comprised of fMRI scans collected while observers viewed over 5000 naturalistic scene and object images. Encoding models based on task features predict activity in different regions across the whole brain. Features from 3D tasks such as keypoint/edge detection explain greater variance compared to 2D tasks---a pattern observed across the whole brain. Using results across all 21 task representations, we constructed a ``task graph’’ based on the spatial layout of well-predicted brain areas from each task. A comparison of this brain-derived task structure to the task structure derived from transfer learning accuracy demonstrate that tasks with higher transferability make similar predictions for brain responses from different regions.

Meta-Learning Representations for Continual Learning,"Khurram Javed, Martha White","The reviews had two major concerns: lack of a benchmarking on a complex dataset, and unclear writing. To address these two major issues we:

More importantly, simply fusing features all at once ignores the complex local intercorrelations, leading to the deterioration of prediction. In this work, we first propose a polynomial tensor pooling (PTP) block for integrating multimodal features by considering high-order moments, followed by a tensorized fully connected layer. Treating PTP as a building block, we further establish a hierarchical polynomial fusion network (HPFN) to recursively transmit local correlations into global ones. By stacking multiple PTPs, the expressivity capacity of HPFN enjoys an exponential growth w.r.t. the number of layers, which is shown by the equivalence to a very deep convolutional arithmetic circuits. Various experiments demonstrate that it can achieve the state-of-the-art performance.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/f56d8183992b6c54c92c16a8519a6e2b-Paper.pdf,2019,"fusion, block, features, hpfn, local, multimodal, performance, polynomial, pooling, ptp","hpfn, layer, ptp, fusion, tensor, temporal, order, features, modality, time","{'multilinear': 0.43349814200259607, 'pooling': 0.41027963010060864, 'fusion': 0.3938058337377704, 'multimodal': 0.3810277645563932, 'polynomial': 0.3541135254729448, 'order': 0.3181169443895801, 'high': 0.27472890894329344, 'deep': 0.20350440122083088}","{'fusion': 0.3134924215994293, 'hpfn': 0.2608147851484762, 'ptp': 0.2608147851484762, 'multimodal': 0.2130529156082114, 'pooling': 0.2053649717735333, 'tensor': 0.17520252951538354, 'block': 0.16529104606794662, 'polynomial': 0.14991515839859043, 'deterioration': 0.1304073925742381, 'intercorrelations': 0.1304073925742381}"
A Composable Specification Language for Reinforcement Learning Tasks,"Kishor Jothimurugan, Rajeev Alur, Osbert Bastani","Reinforcement learning is a promising approach for learning control policies for robot tasks. However, specifying complex tasks (e.g., with multiple objectives and safety constraints) can be challenging, since the user must design a reward function that encodes the entire task. Furthermore, the user often needs to manually shape the reward to ensure convergence of the learning algorithm. We propose a language for specifying complex control tasks, along with an algorithm that compiles specifications in our language into a reward function and automatically performs reward shaping.

Learning to Predict 3D Objects with an Interpolation-based Differentiable Renderer,"Wenzheng Chen, Huan Ling, Jun Gao, Edward Smith, Jaakko Lehtinen, Alec Jacobson, Sanja Fidler","Many machine learning models operate on images, but ignore the fact that images are 2D projections formed by 3D geometry interacting with light, in a process called rendering. Enabling ML models to understand image formation might be key for generalization. However, due to an essential rasterization step involving discrete assignment operations, rendering pipelines are non-differentiable and thus largely inaccessible to gradient-based ML techniques. In this paper, we present DIB-Render, a novel rendering framework through which gradients can be analytically computed. Key to our approach is to view rasterization as a weighted interpolation, allowing image gradients to back-propagate through various standard vertex shaders within a single framework. Our approach supports optimizing over vertex positions, colors, normals, light directions and texture coordinates, and allows us to incorporate various well-known lighting models from graphics.

On the Utility of Learning about Humans for Human-AI Coordination,"Micah Carroll, Rohin Shah, Mark K. Ho, Tom Griffiths, Sanjit Seshia, Pieter Abbeel, Anca Dragan","While we would like agents that can coordinate with humans, current algorithms such as self-play and population-based training create agents that can coordinate with themselves. Agents that assume their partner to be optimal or similar to them can converge to coordination protocols that fail to understand and be understood by humans. To demonstrate this, we introduce a simple environment that requires challenging coordination, based on the popular game Overcooked, and learn a simple model that mimics human play. We evaluate the performance of agents trained via self-play and population-based training. These agents perform very well when paired with themselves, but when paired with our human model, they are significantly worse than agents designed to play with the human model. An experiment with a planning algorithm yields the same conclusion, though only when the human-aware planner is given the exact human model that it is playing with. A user study with real humans shows this pattern as well, though less strongly. Qualitatively, we find that the gains come from having the agent adapt to the human's gameplay. Given this result, we suggest several approaches for designing agents that learn about humans in order to better coordinate with them.

"FastSpeech: Fast, Robust and Controllable Text to Speech","Yi Ren, Yangjun Ruan, Xu Tan, Tao Qin, Sheng Zhao, Zhou Zhao, Tie-Yan Liu","Neural network based end-to-end text to speech (TTS) has significantly improved the quality of synthesized speech. Prominent methods (e.g., Tacotron 2) usually first generate mel-spectrogram from text, and then synthesize speech from the mel-spectrogram using vocoder such as WaveNet. Compared with traditional concatenative and statistical parametric approaches, neural network based end-to-end models suffer from slow inference speed, and the synthesized speech is usually not robust (i.e., some words are skipped or repeated) and lack of controllability (voice speed or prosody control). In this work, we propose a novel feed-forward network based on Transformer to generate mel-spectrogram in parallel for TTS. Specifically, we extract attention alignments from an encoder-decoder based teacher model for phoneme duration prediction, which is used by a length regulator to expand the source phoneme sequence to match the length of the target mel-spectrogram sequence for parallel mel-spectrogram generation. Experiments on the LJSpeech dataset show that our parallel model matches autoregressive models in terms of speech quality, nearly eliminates the problem of word skipping and repeating in particularly hard cases, and can adjust voice speed smoothly. Most importantly, compared with autoregressive Transformer TTS, our model speeds up mel-spectrogram generation by 270x and the end-to-end speech synthesis by 38x. Therefore, we call our model FastSpeech.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/f63f65b503e22cb970527f23c9ad7db1-Paper.pdf,2019,"end, mel, spectrogram, speech, based, model, network, parallel, speed, tts","mel, fastspeech, sequence, phoneme, model, tts, spectrogram, duration, transformer, length","{'fastspeech': 0.4926345963184201, 'speech': 0.4662486879841659, 'controllable': 0.4475275880884481, 'text': 0.3878993666329326, 'fast': 0.3186126158201251, 'robust': 0.2960784621835812}","{'mel': 0.4340218393418145, 'spectrogram': 0.4340218393418145, 'speech': 0.3451945650076538, 'tts': 0.22929198422194194, 'end': 0.22599891612417083, 'parallel': 0.14726830656850842, 'phoneme': 0.1446739464472715, 'speed': 0.1393215994329824, 'voice': 0.1343590721061085, 'synthesized': 0.12756483806896127}"
Maximum Expected Hitting Cost of a Markov Decision Process and Informativeness of Rewards,"Falcon Dai, Matthew Walter","We propose a new complexity measure for Markov decision processes (MDPs), the maximum expected hitting cost (MEHC). This measure tightens the closely related notion of diameter [JOA10] by accounting for the reward structure.
We show that this parameter replaces diameter in the upper bound on the optimal value span of an extended MDP, thus refining the associated upper bounds on the regret of several UCRL2-like algorithms.
Furthermore, we show that potential-based reward shaping [NHR99] can induce equivalent reward functions with varying informativeness, as measured by MEHC.
By analyzing the change in the maximum expected hitting cost, this work presents a formal understanding of the effect of potential-based reward shaping on regret (and sample complexity) in the undiscounted average reward setting.
We further establish that shaping can reduce or increase MEHC by at most a factor of two in a large class of MDPs with finite MEHC and unsaturated optimal average rewards.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/f69041d874533096748e2d77480c1fea-Paper.pdf,2019,"reward, mehc, shaping, average, based, complexity, cost, diameter, expected, hitting","reward, rewards, mdp, state, s0, regret, optimal, mehc, average, expected","{'hitting': 0.3881839027376513, 'informativeness': 0.3881839027376513, 'expected': 0.3411983359689183, 'maximum': 0.33184924906655483, 'rewards': 0.33184924906655483, 'process': 0.3170974844211747, 'cost': 0.31105780455369664, 'decision': 0.2922016090165484, 'markov': 0.2815542752629364}","{'mehc': 0.4676323821295655, 'reward': 0.34242963000952137, 'shaping': 0.2926841532103967, 'hitting': 0.2124073234507777, 'diameter': 0.20551520748610533, 'mdps': 0.16269747225809528, 'potential': 0.1428728732955795, 'average': 0.13978164884182456, 'expected': 0.13439648867941786, 'maximum': 0.13089616596491604}"

Adaptive Influence Maximization with Myopic Feedback,"Binghui Peng, Wei Chen","We study the adaptive influence maximization problem with myopic feedback under the independent cascade model: one sequentially selects k nodes as seeds one by one from a social network, and each selected seed returns the immediate neighbors it activates as the feedback available for by later selections, and the goal is to maximize the expected number of total activated nodes, referred as the influence spread. We show that the adaptivity gap, the ratio between the optimal adaptive influence spread and the optimal non-adaptive influence spread, is at most 4 and at least e/(e-1), and the approximation ratios with respect to the optimal adaptive influence spread of both the non-adaptive greedy and adaptive greedy algorithms are at least \frac{1}{4}(1 - \frac{1}{e}) and at most \frac{e^2 + 1}{(e + 1)^2} < 1 - \frac{1}{e}. Moreover, the approximation ratio of the non-adaptive greedy algorithm is no worse than that of the adaptive greedy algorithm, when considering all graphs.

Variational Bayes under Model Misspecification,"Yixin Wang, David Blei","Variational Bayes (VB) is a scalable alternative to Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for Bayesian posterior inference. Though popular, VB comes with few theoretical guarantees, most of which focus on well-specified models. However, models are rarely well-specified in practice. In this work, we study VB under model misspecification. We prove the VB posterior is asymptotically normal and centers at the value that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to the true data-generating distribution. Moreover, the VB posterior mean centers at the same value and is also asymptotically normal. These results generalize the variational Bernstein--von Mises theorem [29] to misspecified models. As a consequence of these results, we find that the model misspecification error dominates the variational approximation error in VB posterior predictive distributions. It explains the widely observed phenomenon that VB achieves comparable predictive accuracy with MCMC even though VB uses an approximating family. As illustrations, we study VB under three forms of model misspecification, ranging from model over-/under-dispersion to latent dimensionality misspecification. We conduct two simulation studies that demonstrate the theoretical results.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/f7ae58c7f1a1cc4abe9273a0f971ba2a-Paper.pdf,2019,"vb, misspecification, model, posterior, models, results, variational, asymptotically, centers, error","posterior, vb, model, models, exact, predictive, variational, data, misspeciﬁcation, latent","{'misspecification': 0.6465352463230143, 'bayes': 0.5281380777327306, 'variational': 0.404563232761996, 'model': 0.3733509566185391}","{'vb': 0.7365295510004679, 'misspecification': 0.30981352496862313, 'posterior': 0.18730097174049143, 'centers': 0.13992038120253636, 'variational': 0.12587518495722885, 'mcmc': 0.12160114230043592, 'normal': 0.1201094627454636, 'specified': 0.11616752884941316, 'though': 0.11182887230053218, 'asymptotically': 0.10585605938483514}"

Constrained deep neural network architecture search for IoT devices accounting for hardware calibration,"Florian Scheidegger, Luca Benini, Costas Bekas, A. Cristiano I.

However, the design of network topologies is a complex task, and the research community is conducting ongoing efforts to discover top-accuracy topologies, either manually or by employing expensive architecture searches. We propose a unique narrow-space architecture search that focuses on delivering low-cost and rapidly executing networks that respect strict memory and time requirements typical of Internet-of-Things (IoT) near-sensor computing platforms. Our approach provides solutions with classification latencies below 10~ms running on a low-cost device with 1~GB RAM and a peak performance of 5.6~GFLOPS. The narrow-space search of floating-point models improves the accuracy on CIFAR10 of an established IoT model from 70.64% to 74.87% within the same memory constraints. We further improve the accuracy to 82.07% by including 16-bit half types and obtain the highest accuracy of 83.45% by extending the search with model-optimized IEEE 754 reduced types. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical demonstration of more than 3000 trained models that run with reduced precision and push the Pareto optimal front by a wide margin.

The continuous Bernoulli: fixing a pervasive error in variational autoencoders,"Gabriel Loaiza-Ganem, John P. Cunningham","Variational autoencoders (VAE) have quickly become a central tool in machine learning, applicable to a broad range of data types and latent variable models.  By far the most common first step, taken by seminal papers and by core software libraries alike, is to model MNIST data using a deep network parameterizing a Bernoulli likelihood.  This practice contains what appears to be and what is often set aside as a minor inconvenience: the pixel data is [0,1] valued, not {0,1} as supported by the Bernoulli likelihood.  Here we show that, far from being a triviality or nuisance that is convenient to ignore, this error has profound importance to VAE, both qualitative and quantitative.  We introduce and fully characterize a new [0,1]-supported, single parameter distribution: the continuous Bernoulli, which patches this pervasive bug in VAE.

Verified Uncertainty Calibration,"Ananya Kumar, Percy S. Liang, Tengyu Ma","Applications such as weather forecasting and personalized medicine demand models that output calibrated probability estimates---those representative of the true likelihood of a prediction. Most models are not calibrated out of the box but are recalibrated by post-processing model outputs. We find in this work that popular recalibration methods like Platt scaling and temperature scaling are (i) less calibrated than reported, and (ii) current techniques cannot estimate how miscalibrated they are. An alternative method, histogram binning, has measurable calibration error but is sample inefficient---it requires $O(B/\epsilon^2)$ samples, compared to $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ for scaling methods, where $B$ is the number of distinct probabilities the model can output. To get the best of both worlds, we introduce the scaling-binning calibrator, which first fits a parametric function that acts like a baseline for variance reduction and then bins the function values to actually ensure calibration. This requires only $O(1/\epsilon^2 + B)$ samples. We then show that methods used to estimate calibration error are suboptimal---we prove that an alternative estimator introduced in the meteorological community requires fewer samples ($O(\sqrt{B})$ instead of $O(B)$). We validate our approach with multiclass calibration experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, where we obtain a 35\% lower calibration error than histogram binning and, unlike scaling methods, guarantees on true calibration.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/f8c0c968632845cd133308b1a494967f-Paper.pdf,2019,"calibration, scaling, methods, binning, calibrated, epsilon, error, requires, samples, alternative","calibration, error, binning, model, scaling, bins, estimator, squared, 10, samples","{'verified': 0.6725302838225503, 'calibration': 0.5612356034386381, 'uncertainty': 0.48240814128124704}","{'calibration': 0.4442802431561073, 'scaling': 0.31768651994410013, 'binning': 0.30271047068271556, 'calibrated': 0.23835353978080284, 'histogram': 0.19099803498664425, 'epsilon': 0.18825904456787693, 'requires': 0.14588170142596077, 'samples': 0.13487607729594692, 'error': 0.1314217976346869, 'alternative': 0.12550602971191796}"
Episodic Memory in Lifelong Language Learning,"Cyprien de Masson d'Autume, Sebastian Ruder, Lingpeng Kong, Dani Yogatama",We introduce a lifelong language learning setup where a model needs to learn from a stream of text examples without any dataset identifier. We propose an episodic memory model that performs sparse experience replay and local adaptation to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in this setup. Experiments on text classification and question answering demonstrate the complementary benefits of sparse experience replay and local adaptation to allow the model to continuously learn from new datasets. We also show that the space complexity of the episodic memory module can be reduced significantly (~50-90%) by randomly choosing which examples to store in memory with a minimal decrease in performance. We consider an episodic memory component as a crucial building block of general linguistic intelligence and see our model as a first step in that direction.,https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/f8d2e80c1458ea2501f98a2cafadb397-Paper.pdf,2019,"memory, model, episodic, adaptation, examples, experience, learn, local, replay, setup","latexit, examples, model, memory, sha1_base64, training, dataset, mbpa, adaptation, local","{'lifelong': 0.5658866923008161, 'episodic': 0.525540449831052, 'memory': 0.43367198744784824, 'language': 0.42436919860107286, 'learning': 0.18819903732467266}","{'episodic': 0.37230395636053937, 'memory': 0.3246136580122295, 'replay': 0.2203817979444805, 'setup': 0.21348424635329713, 'adaptation': 0.19651204627412425, 'experience': 0.1925609583152681, 'text': 0.18164635821239433, 'model': 0.15695417801650696, 'examples': 0.1538255185831819, 'sparse': 0.15335051910611558}"
MetaQuant: Learning to Quantize by Learning to Penetrate Non-differentiable Quantization,"Shangyu Chen, Wenya Wang, Sinno Jialin Pan","Tremendous amount of parameters make deep neural networks impractical to be deployed for edge-device-based real-world applications due to the limit of computational power and storage space. Existing studies have made progress on learning quantized deep models to reduce model size and energy consumption, i.e. converting full-precision weights ($r$'s) into discrete values ($q$'s) in a supervised training manner. However, the training process for quantization is non-differentiable, which leads to either infinite or zero gradients ($g_r$) w.r.t. $r$. To address this problem, most training-based quantization methods use the gradient w.r.t. $q$ ($g_q$) with clipping to approximate $g_r$ by Straight-Through-Estimator (STE) or manually design their computation. However, these methods only heuristically make training-based quantization applicable, without further analysis on how the approximated gradients can assist training of a quantized network. In this paper, we propose to learn $g_r$ by a neural network. Specifically, a meta network is trained using $g_q$ and $r$ as inputs, and outputs $g_r$ for subsequent weight updates. The meta network is updated together with the original quantized network. Our proposed method alleviates the problem of non-differentiability, and can be trained in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments are conducted with CIFAR10/100 and ImageNet on various deep networks to demonstrate the advantage of our proposed method in terms of a faster convergence rate and better performance.

Normalization Helps Training of Quantized LSTM,"Lu Hou, Jinhua Zhu, James Kwok, Fei Gao, Tao Qin, Tie-Yan Liu","The long-short-term memory (LSTM), though powerful, is memory and computa\x02tion expensive. To alleviate this problem, one approach is to compress its weights by quantization. However, existing quantization methods usually have inferior performance when used on LSTMs. In this paper, we first show theoretically that training a quantized LSTM is difficult because quantization makes the exploding gradient problem more severe, particularly when the LSTM weight matrices are large. We then show that the popularly used weight/layer/batch normalization schemes can help stabilize the gradient magnitude in training quantized LSTMs. Empirical results show that the normalized quantized LSTMs achieve significantly better results than their unnormalized counterparts.

Differentially Private Bayesian Linear Regression,"Garrett Bernstein, Daniel R. Sheldon","Linear regression is an important tool across many fields that work with sensitive human-sourced data. Significant prior work has focused on producing differentially private point estimates, which provide a privacy guarantee to individuals while still allowing modelers to draw insights from data by estimating regression coefficients. We investigate the problem of Bayesian linear regression, with the goal of computing posterior distributions that correctly quantify uncertainty given privately released statistics.

Wasserstein Dependency Measure for Representation Learning,"Sherjil Ozair, Corey Lynch, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron van den Oord, Sergey Levine, Pierre Sermanet","Mutual information maximization has emerged as a powerful learning objective for unsupervised representation learning obtaining state-of-the-art performance in applications such as object recognition, speech recognition, and reinforcement learning. However, such approaches are fundamentally limited since a tight lower bound on mutual information requires sample size exponential in the mutual information. This limits the applicability of these approaches for prediction tasks with high mutual information, such as in video understanding or reinforcement learning. In these settings, such techniques are prone to overfit, both in theory and in practice, and capture only a few of the relevant factors of variation. This leads to incomplete representations that are not optimal for downstream tasks. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that mutual information-based representation learning approaches do fail to learn complete representations on a number of designed and real-world tasks. To mitigate these problems we introduce the Wasserstein dependency measure, which learns more complete representations by using the Wasserstein distance instead of the KL divergence in the mutual information estimator. We show that a practical approximation to this theoretically motivated solution, constructed using Lipschitz constraint techniques from the GAN literature, achieves substantially improved results on tasks where incomplete representations are a major challenge.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/f9209b7866c9f69823201c1732cc8645-Paper.pdf,2019,"information, mutual, learning, representations, tasks, approaches, complete, incomplete, recognition, reinforcement","information, mutual, learning, wasserstein, representation, dataset, data, performance, representations, size","{'dependency': 0.5882848815337477, 'measure': 0.5170792019952513, 'wasserstein': 0.44282564972933813, 'representation': 0.39518081485179374, 'learning': 0.18516901613833947}","{'mutual': 0.5231239396830883, 'information': 0.2961436291012448, 'representations': 0.2247048393762334, 'incomplete': 0.19541720076189717, 'tasks': 0.16937257070767847, 'recognition': 0.15627561605593931, 'complete': 0.15342303284994677, 'wasserstein': 0.15165049168663833, 'approaches': 0.15044538165406482, 'learning': 0.1362257810660245}"
Multi-Agent Common Knowledge Reinforcement Learning,"Christian Schroeder de Witt, Jakob Foerster, Gregory Farquhar, Philip Torr, Wendelin Boehmer, Shimon Whiteson","Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning often requires decentralised policies, which severely limit the agents' ability to coordinate their behaviour. In this paper, we show that common knowledge between agents allows for complex decentralised coordination. Common knowledge arises naturally in a large number of decentralised cooperative multi-agent tasks, for example, when agents can reconstruct parts of each others' observations. Since agents can independently agree on their common knowledge, they can execute complex coordinated policies that condition on this knowledge in a fully decentralised fashion. We propose multi-agent common knowledge reinforcement learning (MACKRL), a novel stochastic actor-critic algorithm that learns a hierarchical policy tree. Higher levels in the hierarchy coordinate groups of agents by conditioning on their common knowledge, or delegate to lower levels with smaller subgroups but potentially richer common knowledge. The entire policy tree can be executed in a fully decentralised fashion. As the lowest policy tree level consists of independent policies for each agent, MACKRL reduces to independently learnt decentralised policies as a special case. We demonstrate that  our method can exploit common knowledge for superior performance on complex decentralised coordination tasks, including a stochastic matrix game and challenging problems in StarCraft II unit micromanagement.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/f968fdc88852a4a3a27a81fe3f57bfc5-Paper.pdf,2019,"knowledge, common, decentralised, agents, agent, policies, complex, multi, policy, tree","common, knowledge, agents, mackrl, agent, al, et, policies, env, ug","{'common': 0.5846428885430216, 'knowledge': 0.46848344837480266, 'agent': 0.44008417538068034, 'multi': 0.3315499969468174, 'reinforcement': 0.31820139904915706, 'learning': 0.1840226595345164}","{'decentralised': 0.5376662476534921, 'knowledge': 0.31437526786420056, 'common': 0.30954660269707096, 'agents': 0.24527796593769718, 'policies': 0.19096030763402114, 'agent': 0.1728457821482715, 'mackrl': 0.1691024208286791, 'tree': 0.1493292677692125, 'coordination': 0.1445616651581229, 'cooperative': 0.13550440241524808}"
Subspace Detours: Building Transport Plans that are Optimal on Subspace Projections,"Boris Muzellec, Marco Cuturi","Computing optimal transport (OT) between measures in high dimensions is doomed by the curse of dimensionality. A popular approach to avoid this curse is to project input measures on lower-dimensional subspaces (1D lines in the case of sliced Wasserstein distances), solve the OT problem between these reduced measures, and settle for the Wasserstein distance between these reductions, rather than that between the original measures. This approach is however difficult to extend to the case in which one wants to compute an OT map (a Monge map) between the original measures. Since computations are carried out on lower-dimensional projections, classical map estimation techniques can only produce maps operating in these reduced dimensions. We propose in this work two methods to extrapolate, from an transport map that is optimal on a subspace, one that is nearly optimal in the entire space. We prove that the best optimal transport plan that takes such ""subspace detours"" is a generalization of the Knothe-Rosenblatt transport. We show that these plans can be explicitly formulated when comparing Gaussian measures (between which the Wasserstein distance is commonly referred to as the Bures or Fréchet distance). We provide an algorithm to select optimal subspaces given pairs of Gaussian measures, and study scenarios in which that mediating subspace can be selected using prior information.

The Broad Optimality of Profile Maximum Likelihood,"Yi Hao, Alon Orlitsky","We study three fundamental statistical-learning problems: distribution estimation, property estimation, and property testing.

Exact sampling of determinantal point processes with sublinear time preprocessing,"Michal Derezinski, Daniele Calandriello, Michal Valko","We study the complexity of sampling from a distribution over all index subsets of the set {1, ..., n} with the probability of a subset S proportional to the determinant of the submatrix LS of some n x n positive semidefinite matrix L, where LS corresponds to the entries of L indexed by S. Known as a determinantal point process (DPP), this distribution is used in machine learning to induce diversity in subset selection. When sampling from DDPs, we often wish to sample multiple subsets S with small expected size k = E[|S|] << n from a very large matrix L, so it is important to minimize the preprocessing cost of the procedure (performed once) as well as the sampling cost (performed repeatedly). For this purpose we provide DPP-VFX, a new algorithm which, given access only to L, samples exactly from a determinantal point process while satisfying the following two properties: (1) its preprocessing cost is n poly(k), i.e., sublinear in the size of L, and (2) its sampling cost is poly(k), i.e., independent of the size of L. Prior to our results, state-of-the-art exact samplers required O(n^3) preprocessing time and sampling time linear in n or dependent on the spectral properties of L.

Neural Diffusion Distance for Image Segmentation,"Jian Sun, Zongben Xu","Diffusion distance is a spectral method for measuring distance among nodes on graph considering global data structure. In this work, we propose a spec-diff-net for computing diffusion distance on graph based on approximate spectral decomposition. The network is a differentiable deep architecture consisting of  feature extraction and diffusion distance modules for computing diffusion distance on image by end-to-end training.  We design low resolution kernel matching loss and high resolution segment matching loss to enforce the network's output to be consistent with human-labeled image segments.

Experience Replay for Continual Learning,"David Rolnick, Arun Ahuja, Jonathan Schwarz, Timothy Lillicrap, Gregory Wayne","Interacting with a complex world involves continual learning, in which tasks and data distributions change over time. A continual learning system should demonstrate both plasticity (acquisition of new knowledge) and stability (preservation of old knowledge). Catastrophic forgetting is the failure of stability, in which new experience overwrites previous experience. In the brain, replay of past experience is widely believed to reduce forgetting, yet it has been largely overlooked as a solution to forgetting in deep reinforcement learning. Here, we introduce CLEAR, a replay-based method that greatly reduces catastrophic forgetting in multi-task reinforcement learning. CLEAR leverages off-policy learning and behavioral cloning from replay to enhance stability, as well as on-policy learning to preserve plasticity. We show that CLEAR performs better than state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for mitigating forgetting, despite being significantly less complicated and not requiring any knowledge of the individual tasks being learned.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/fa7cdfad1a5aaf8370ebeda47a1ff1c3-Paper.pdf,2019,"learning, forgetting, clear, experience, knowledge, replay, stability, catastrophic, continual, deep","tasks, forgetting, training, learning, clear, replay, task, performance, catastrophic, policy","{'experience': 0.6022692880872261, 'replay': 0.5667599191656718, 'continual': 0.5220234050583945, 'learning': 0.2086778934757258}","{'forgetting': 0.46764733180616036, 'replay': 0.2703642311111421, 'clear': 0.26190231978319506, 'experience': 0.2362336450764764, 'stability': 0.2347184477662795, 'plasticity': 0.21842520576062954, 'catastrophic': 0.19254276450590785, 'learning': 0.19096425728830788, 'continual': 0.18705893272246416, 'knowledge': 0.17324598811659986}"
Efficient online learning with kernels for adversarial large scale problems,"Rémi Jézéquel, Pierre Gaillard, Alessandro Rudi","We are interested in a framework of online learning with kernels for low-dimensional, but large-scale and potentially adversarial datasets. 
We study the computational and theoretical performance of online variations of kernel Ridge regression. Despite its simplicity, the algorithm we study is the first  to achieve the optimal regret for a wide range of kernels with a per-round complexity of order $n^\alpha$ with $\alpha < 2$. 

The algorithm we consider is based on approximating the kernel with the linear span of basis functions. Our contributions are twofold: 1) For the Gaussian kernel, we propose to build the basis beforehand (independently of the data) through Taylor expansion. For $d$-dimensional inputs, we provide a (close to) optimal regret of order $O((\log n)^{d+1})$ with per-round time complexity and space complexity $O((\log n)^{2d})$. This makes the algorithm a suitable choice as soon as $n \gg e^d$ which is likely to happen in a scenario with small dimensional and large-scale dataset; 2) For general kernels with low effective dimension, the basis functions are updated sequentially, adapting to the data, by sampling Nyström points.

KNG: The K-Norm Gradient Mechanism,"Matthew Reimherr, Jordan Awan","This paper presents a new mechanism for producing sanitized statistical summaries that achieve {\it differential privacy}, called the {\it K-Norm Gradient} Mechanism, or KNG. This new approach maintains the strong flexibility of the exponential mechanism, while achieving the powerful utility performance of objective perturbation. KNG starts with an inherent objective function (often an empirical risk), and promotes summaries that are close to minimizing the objective by weighting according to how far the gradient of the objective function is from zero.  Working with the gradient instead of the original objective function allows for additional flexibility as one can penalize using different norms.  We show that, unlike the exponential mechanism, the noise added by KNG is asymptotically negligible compared to the statistical error for many problems.

On the Downstream Performance of Compressed Word Embeddings,"Avner May, Jian Zhang, Tri Dao, Christopher Ré","Compressing word embeddings is important for deploying NLP models in memory-constrained settings. However, understanding what makes compressed embeddings perform well on downstream tasks is challenging---existing measures of compression quality often fail to distinguish between embeddings that perform well and those that do not. We thus propose the eigenspace overlap score as a new measure. We relate the eigenspace overlap score to downstream performance by developing generalization bounds for the compressed embeddings in terms of this score, in the context of linear and logistic regression. We then show that we can lower bound the eigenspace overlap score for a simple uniform quantization compression method, helping to explain the strong empirical performance of this method. Finally, we show that by using the eigenspace overlap score as a selection criterion between embeddings drawn from a representative set we compressed, we can efficiently identify the better performing embedding with up to 2x lower selection error rates than the next best measure of compression quality, and avoid the cost of training a separate model for each task of interest.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/faf02b2358de8933f480a146f4d2d98e-Paper.pdf,2019,"embeddings, score, eigenspace, overlap, compressed, compression, downstream, lower, measure, method","score, embeddings, performance, overlap, compression, eigenspace, embedding, compressed, downstream, quality","{'downstream': 0.5067485079556888, 'compressed': 0.4796066470726655, 'word': 0.43320732942484685, 'performance': 0.41394987266005145, 'embeddings': 0.39263255904944805}","{'eigenspace': 0.4156289733943264, 'overlap': 0.39894038695752326, 'embeddings': 0.33736102415935054, 'score': 0.3281698588151596, 'compressed': 0.2479244988449302, 'compression': 0.21612512586538726, 'downstream': 0.1440834172435915, 'selection': 0.12241026947756597, 'measure': 0.11860083463169459, 'quality': 0.11729210468925004}"

For a wide variety of settings, we provide both lower and upper bounds, identifying precisely how the choice of loss function and assumptions on the data distribution interact to determine the mini-max optimal convergence rate. We also show that, in many cases, linear distribution estimates, such as the empirical distribution or kernel density estimator, cannot converge at the optimal rate. These bounds generalize, unify, or improve on several recent and classical results. Moreover, IPMs can be used to formalize a statistical model of generative adversarial networks (GANs).

Efficient Near-Optimal Testing of Community Changes in Balanced Stochastic Block Models,"Aditya Gangrade, Praveen Venkatesh, Bobak Nazer, Venkatesh Saligrama","We propose and analyze the  problems of \textit{community goodness-of-fit and two-sample testing} for stochastic block models (SBM), where changes arise due to modification in community memberships of nodes. Motivated by practical applications, we consider the challenging sparse regime, where expected node degrees are constant, and the inter-community mean degree ($b$) scales proportionally to intra-community mean degree ($a$). Prior work has sharply characterized partial or full community recovery in terms of a  ``signal-to-noise ratio'' ($\mathrm{SNR}$) based on $a$ and $b$. For both problems, we propose computationally-efficient tests that can succeed far beyond the regime where recovery of community membership is even possible. Overall, for large changes, $s \gg \sqrt{n}$, we need only $\mathrm{SNR}= O(1)$ whereas a na\""ive test based on community recovery with $O(s)$ errors requires $\mathrm{SNR}= \Theta(\log n)$. Conversely, in the small change regime, $s \ll \sqrt{n}$, via an information theoretic lower bound, we show that, surprisingly, no algorithm can do better than the na\""ive algorithm that first estimates the community up to $O(s)$ errors and then detects changes.

Online Convex Matrix Factorization with Representative Regions,"Jianhao Peng, Olgica Milenkovic, Abhishek Agarwal","Matrix factorization (MF) is a versatile learning method that has found wide applications in various data-driven disciplines. Still, many MF algorithms do not adequately scale with the size of available datasets and/or lack interpretability. To improve the computational efficiency of the method, an online (streaming) MF algorithm was proposed in Mairal et al., 2010. To enable data interpretability, a constrained version of MF, termed convex MF, was introduced in Ding et al., 2010. In the latter work, the basis vectors are required to lie in the convex hull of the data samples, thereby ensuring that every basis can be interpreted as a weighted combination of data samples. No current algorithmic solutions for online convex MF are known as it is challenging to find adequate convex bases without having access to the complete dataset. We address both problems by proposing the first online convex MF algorithm that maintains a collection of constant-size sets of representative data samples needed for interpreting each of the basis (Ding et al., 2010) and has the same almost sure convergence guarantees as the online learning algorithm of Mairal et al., 2010. Our proof techniques combine random coordinate descent algorithms with specialized quasi-martingale convergence analysis. Experiments on synthetic and real world datasets show significant computational savings of the proposed online convex MF method compared to classical convex MF. Since the proposed method maintains small representative sets of data samples needed for convex interpretations, it is related to a body of work in theoretical computer science, pertaining to generating point sets (Blum et al., 2016), and in computer vision, pertaining to archetypal analysis (Mei et al., 2018).

much more for the underrepresented classes and subgroups.For example, a gender classification model trained using DP-SGD exhibits
much lower accuracy for black faces than for white faces.  Critically,
this gap is bigger in the DP model than in the non-DP model, i.e., if
the original model is unfair, the unfairness becomes worse once DP is
applied.  We demonstrate this effect for a variety of tasks and models,
including sentiment analysis of text and image classification.  We then
explain why DP training mechanisms such as gradient clipping and noise
addition have disproportionate effect on the underrepresented and more
complex subgroups, resulting in a disparate reduction of model accuracy.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/fc0de4e0396fff257ea362983c2dda5a-Paper.pdf,2019,"dp, model, accuracy, models, training, classification, cost, demonstrate, differential, effect","dp, model, accuracy, class, training, noise, learning, 20, 60, models","{'disparate': 0.48204751789196765, 'impact': 0.4626920538027158, 'accuracy': 0.4250406868098073, 'differential': 0.3784052282720044, 'privacy': 0.3784052282720044, 'model': 0.29411840274129303}","{'dp': 0.6849546491175512, 'underrepresented': 0.20519579555993314, 'faces': 0.18640749179838614, 'subgroups': 0.18640749179838614, 'accuracy': 0.16828763208288752, 'model': 0.15899427259493912, 'sgd': 0.12538444308032207, 'effect': 0.12267160160363058, 'privacy': 0.12267160160363058, 'differential': 0.1174088489318226}"
Fair Algorithms for Clustering,"Suman Bera, Deeparnab Chakrabarty, Nicolas Flores, Maryam Negahbani","We study the problem of finding low-cost {\em fair clusterings} in data where each data point may belong to many protected groups. Our work significantly generalizes the seminal work of Chierichetti \etal (NIPS 2017) as follows.
    - We allow the user to specify the parameters that define fair representation. More precisely, these parameters define the maximum over- and minimum under-representation of any group in any cluster.
    - Our clustering algorithm works on any $\ell_p$-norm objective (e.g. $k$-means, $k$-median, and $k$-center). Indeed, our algorithm transforms any vanilla clustering solution into a fair one incurring only a slight loss in quality.
    - Our algorithm also allows individuals to lie in multiple protected groups. 
    In other words, we do not need the protected groups to partition the data and we can maintain fairness across different groups simultaneously.

Approximating Interactive Human Evaluation with Self-Play for Open-Domain Dialog Systems,"Asma Ghandeharioun, Judy Hanwen Shen, Natasha Jaques, Craig Ferguson, Noah Jones, Agata Lapedriza, Rosalind Picard","Building an open-domain conversational agent is a challenging problem. Current evaluation methods, mostly post-hoc judgments of static conversation, do not capture conversation quality in a realistic interactive context. In this paper, we investigate interactive human evaluation and provide evidence for its necessity; we then introduce a novel, model-agnostic, and dataset-agnostic method to approximate it. In particular, we propose a self-play scenario where the dialog system talks to itself and we calculate a combination of proxies such as sentiment and semantic coherence on the conversation trajectory. We show that this metric is capable of capturing the human-rated quality of a dialog model better than any automated metric known to-date, achieving a significant Pearson correlation (r>.7, p<.05). To investigate the strengths of this novel metric and interactive evaluation in comparison to state-of-the-art metrics and human evaluation of static conversations, we perform extended experiments with a set of models, including several that make novel improvements to recent hierarchical dialog generation architectures through sentiment and semantic knowledge distillation on the utterance level.

Robust Multi-agent Counterfactual Prediction,"Alexander Peysakhovich, Christian Kroer, Adam Lerer","We consider the problem of using logged data to make predictions about what would happen if we changed the `rules of the game' in a multi-agent system. This task is difficult because in many cases we observe actions individuals take but not their private information or their full reward functions. In addition, agents are strategic, so when the rules change, they will also change their actions. Existing methods (e.g. structural estimation, inverse reinforcement learning) assume that agents' behavior comes from optimizing some utility or that the system is in equilibrium. They make counterfactual predictions by using observed actions to learn the underlying utility function (a.k.a. type) and then solving for the equilibrium of the counterfactual environment. This approach imposes heavy assumptions such as the rationality of the agents being observed and a correct model of the environment and agents' utility functions. We propose a method for analyzing the sensitivity of counterfactual conclusions to violations of these assumptions, which we call robust multi-agent counterfactual prediction (RMAC). We provide a first-order method for computing RMAC bounds.

On Tractable Computation of Expected Predictions,"Pasha Khosravi, YooJung Choi, Yitao Liang, Antonio Vergari, Guy Van den Broeck","Computing expected predictions of discriminative models is a fundamental task in machine learning that appears in many interesting applications such as fairness, handling missing values, and data analysis. Unfortunately, computing expectations of a discriminative model with respect to a probability distribution defined by an arbitrary generative model has been proven to be hard in general. In fact, the task is intractable even for simple models such as logistic regression and a naive Bayes distribution. In this paper, we identify a pair of generative and discriminative models that enables tractable computation of expectations, as well as moments of any order, of the latter with respect to the former in case of regression. Specifically, we consider expressive probabilistic circuits with certain structural constraints that support tractable  probabilistic inference. Moreover, we exploit the tractable computation of high-order moments to derive an algorithm to approximate the expectations for classification scenarios in which exact computations are intractable. Our framework to compute expected predictions allows for handling of missing data during prediction time in a principled and accurate way and enables reasoning about the behavior of discriminative models. We empirically show our algorithm to consistently outperform standard imputation techniques on a variety of datasets.

Stagewise Training Accelerates Convergence of Testing Error Over SGD,"Zhuoning Yuan, Yan Yan, Rong Jin, Tianbao Yang","Stagewise training strategy is  widely used for learning neural networks, which runs a stochastic algorithm (e.g., SGD) starting with a relatively large step size (aka learning rate) and geometrically decreasing the step size after a number of iterations.  It has been  observed  that the stagewise SGD has much faster convergence  than the vanilla SGD with a polynomially decaying step size in terms of both training error and testing error. {\it But how to explain this phenomenon has been largely ignored by existing studies.} This paper provides some theoretical evidence for explaining this faster convergence. In particular, we consider a stagewise training strategy for minimizing empirical risk that satisfies the  Polyak-\L ojasiewicz (PL) condition, which has been observed/proved for neural networks and also holds for a broad family of convex functions. For convex loss functions and two classes of ``nice-behaviored"" non-convex objectives that are close to a convex function, we establish faster convergence of stagewise training than the vanilla SGD under the PL condition on both training error and testing error.

Specific and Shared Causal Relation Modeling and Mechanism-Based Clustering,"Biwei Huang, Kun Zhang, Pengtao Xie, Mingming Gong, Eric P. Xing, Clark Glymour","State-of-the-art approaches to causal discovery usually assume a fixed underlying causal model. However, it is often the case that causal models vary across domains or subjects, due to possibly omitted factors that affect the quantitative causal effects. As a typical example, causal connectivity in the brain network has been reported to vary across individuals, with significant differences across groups of people, such as autistics and typical controls. In this paper, we develop a unified framework for causal discovery and mechanism-based group identification. In particular, we propose a specific and shared causal model (SSCM), which takes into account the variabilities of causal relations across individuals/groups and leverages their commonalities to achieve statistically reliable estimation. The learned SSCM gives the specific causal knowledge for each individual as well as the general trend over the population.

Computational Separations between Sampling and Optimization,Kunal Talwar,"Two commonly arising computational tasks in Bayesian learning are Optimization (Maximum A Posteriori estimation) and Sampling (from the posterior distribution). In the convex case these two problems are efficiently reducible to each other. Recent work (Ma et al. 2019) shows that in the non-convex case, sampling can sometimes be provably faster. We present a simpler and stronger separation.
We then compare sampling and optimization in more detail and show that they are provably incomparable: there are families of continuous functions for which optimization is easy but sampling is NP-hard, and vice versa.  Further, we show function families that exhibit a sharp phase transition in the computational complexity of sampling, as one varies the natural temperature parameter.

Classification Accuracy Score for Conditional Generative Models,"Suman Ravuri, Oriol Vinyals","Deep generative models (DGMs) of images are now sufficiently mature that they produce nearly photorealistic samples and obtain scores similar to the data distribution on heuristics such as Frechet Inception Distance (FID). These results, especially on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet, suggest that DGMs are learning the data distribution in a perceptually meaningful space and can be used in downstream tasks. To test this latter hypothesis, we use class-conditional generative models from a number of model classes—variational autoencoders, autoregressive models, and generative adversarial networks (GANs)—to infer the class labels of real data. We perform this inference by training an image classifier using only synthetic data and using the classifier to predict labels on real data. The performance on this task, which we call Classification Accuracy Score (CAS), reveals some surprising results not identified by traditional metrics and constitute our contributions. First, when using a state-of-the-art GAN (BigGAN-deep), Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy decrease by 27.9% and 41.6%, respectively, compared to the original data; and conditional generative models from other model classes, such as Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder-2 (VQ-VAE-2) and Hierarchical Autoregressive Models (HAMs), substantially outperform GANs on this benchmark.

Unsupervised Meta-Learning for Few-Shot Image Classification,"Siavash Khodadadeh, Ladislau Boloni, Mubarak Shah","Few-shot or one-shot learning of classifiers requires a significant inductive bias towards the type of task to be learned. One way to acquire this is by meta-learning on tasks similar to the target task. In this paper, we propose UMTRA, an algorithm that performs unsupervised, model-agnostic meta-learning for classification tasks.
 The meta-learning step of UMTRA is performed on a flat collection of unlabeled images. While we assume that these images can be grouped into a diverse set of classes and are relevant to the target task, no explicit information about the classes or any labels are needed.  UMTRA uses random sampling and augmentation to create synthetic training tasks for meta-learning phase. Labels are only needed at the final target task learning step, and they can be as little as one sample per class.
 On the Omniglot and Mini-Imagenet few-shot learning benchmarks, UMTRA outperforms every tested approach based on unsupervised learning of representations, while alternating for the best performance with the recent CACTUs algorithm. Compared to supervised model-agnostic meta-learning approaches, UMTRA trades off some classification accuracy for a reduction in the required labels of several orders of magnitude.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/fd0a5a5e367a0955d81278062ef37429-Paper.pdf,2019,"learning, meta, umtra, task, labels, one, shot, target, tasks, agnostic","learning, meta, umtra, data, training, dataset, augmentation, unsupervised, shot, task","{'shot': 0.4690556791258691, 'unsupervised': 0.44294453297286007, 'meta': 0.43574199526681623, 'classification': 0.429094068850758, 'image': 0.40918134031969117, 'learning': 0.20582695392343675}","{'umtra': 0.5536787623420879, 'meta': 0.3310041532044049, 'learning': 0.21881699177592767, 'shot': 0.2018546204395191, 'labels': 0.18295029253399567, 'task': 0.17319559535264253, 'target': 0.1661431935255232, 'needed': 0.14757937240523936, 'agnostic': 0.14426385462259564, 'unsupervised': 0.12451244639209066}"
Transferable Normalization: Towards Improving Transferability of Deep Neural Networks,"Ximei Wang, Ying Jin, Mingsheng Long, Jianmin Wang, Michael I. Jordan","Deep neural networks (DNNs) excel at learning representations when trained on large-scale datasets. Pre-trained DNNs also show strong transferability when fine-tuned to other labeled datasets. However, such transferability becomes weak when the target dataset is fully unlabeled as in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). We envision that the loss of transferability may stem from the intrinsic limitation of the architecture design of DNNs. In this paper, we delve into the components of DNN architectures and propose Transferable Normalization (TransNorm) in place of existing normalization techniques. TransNorm is an end-to-end trainable layer to make DNNs more transferable across domains. As a general method, TransNorm can be easily applied to various deep neural networks and domain adaption methods, without introducing any extra hyper-parameters or learnable parameters. Empirical results justify that TransNorm not only improves classification accuracies but also accelerates convergence for mainstream DNN-based domain adaptation methods.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/fd2c5e4680d9a01dba3aada5ece22270-Paper.pdf,2019,"dnns, transnorm, domain, transferability, adaptation, also, datasets, deep, dnn, end","transnorm, domain, bn, domains, adaptation, transferability, cdan, dann, normalization, target","{'transferable': 0.46848278664971016, 'transferability': 0.44967198187037033, 'improving': 0.39664730133707077, 'normalization': 0.3897580430854217, 'towards': 0.35506160073826765, 'deep': 0.23237397614899064, 'networks': 0.21096465156018956, 'neural': 0.21096465156018956}","{'transnorm': 0.4761726211762823, 'dnns': 0.3634690225392031, 'transferability': 0.291729910604928, 'transferable': 0.2035343630286961, 'dnn': 0.19078226722834565, 'domain': 0.18614825739022192, 'normalization': 0.15741727328919963, 'adaptation': 0.15398289680495592, 'adaption': 0.11904315529407057, 'delve': 0.11904315529407057}"
Semi-Implicit Graph Variational Auto-Encoders,"Arman Hasanzadeh, Ehsan Hajiramezanali, Krishna Narayanan, Nick Duffield, Mingyuan Zhou, Xiaoning Qian","Semi-implicit graph variational auto-encoder (SIG-VAE) is proposed to expand the flexibility of variational graph auto-encoders (VGAE) to model graph data. SIG-VAE employs a hierarchical variational framework to enable neighboring node sharing for better generative modeling of graph dependency structure, together with a Bernoulli-Poisson link decoder. Not only does this hierarchical construction provide a more flexible generative graph model to better capture real-world graph properties, but also does SIG-VAE naturally lead to semi-implicit hierarchical variational inference that allows faithful modeling of implicit posteriors of given graph data, which may exhibit heavy tails, multiple modes, skewness, and rich dependency structures. SIG-VAE integrates a carefully designed generative model, well suited to model real-world sparse graphs, and a sophisticated variational inference network, which propagates the graph structural information and distribution uncertainty to capture complex posteriors. SIG-VAE clearly outperforms a simple combination of VGAE with variational inference, including semi-implicit variational inference~(SIVI) or normalizing flow (NF), which does not propagate uncertainty in its inference network, and provides more interpretable latent representations than VGAE does. Extensive experiments with a variety of graph data show that SIG-VAE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several different graph analytic tasks.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/fd4771e85e1f916f239624486bff502d-Paper.pdf,2019,"graph, variational, sig, vae, inference, implicit, model, data, generative, hierarchical","vae, sig, graph, vgae, node, variational, distribution, model, posterior, latent","{'encoders': 0.5185123800082387, 'auto': 0.4571932225309814, 'implicit': 0.40203695688216673, 'semi': 0.388842300344927, 'variational': 0.3428156346780876, 'graph': 0.3029268235623592}","{'sig': 0.4737204680434449, 'vae': 0.35195095003478755, 'graph': 0.35178586279929475, 'variational': 0.2833610410905905, 'vgae': 0.23686023402172246, 'implicit': 0.1918935908027496, 'inference': 0.17174906336208592, 'semi': 0.14312803492436335, 'hierarchical': 0.13808218411453477, 'posteriors': 0.12653319532531898}"
Efficient Approximation of Deep ReLU Networks for Functions on Low Dimensional Manifolds,"Minshuo Chen, Haoming Jiang, Wenjing Liao, Tuo Zhao","Deep neural networks have revolutionized many real world applications, due to their flexibility in data fitting and accurate predictions for unseen data. A line of research reveals that neural networks can approximate certain classes of functions with an arbitrary accuracy, while the size of the network scales exponentially with respect to the data dimension. Empirical results, however, suggest that networks of moderate size already yield appealing performance. To explain such a gap, a common belief is that many data sets exhibit low dimensional structures, and can be modeled as samples near a low dimensional manifold. In this paper, we prove that neural networks can efficiently approximate functions supported on low dimensional manifolds. The network size scales exponentially in the approximation error, with an exponent depending on the intrinsic dimension of the data and the smoothness of the function. Our result shows that exploiting low dimensional data structures can greatly enhance the efficiency in function approximation by neural networks.

GOT: An Optimal Transport framework for Graph comparison,"Hermina Petric Maretic, Mireille El Gheche, Giovanni Chierchia, Pascal Frossard","We present a novel framework based on optimal transport for the challenging problem of comparing graphs. Specifically, we exploit the probabilistic distribution of smooth graph signals defined with respect to the graph topology. This allows us to derive an explicit expression of the Wasserstein distance between graph signal distributions in terms of the graph Laplacian matrices. This leads to a structurally meaningful measure for comparing graphs, which is able to take into account the global structure of graphs, while most other measures merely observe local changes independently. Our measure is then used for formulating a new graph alignment problem, whose objective is to estimate the permutation that minimizes the distance between two graphs. We further propose an efficient stochastic algorithm based on Bayesian exploration to accommodate for the non-convexity of the graph alignment problem.

Zero-shot Knowledge Transfer via Adversarial Belief Matching,"Paul Micaelli, Amos J.

However, due to growing dataset sizes and stricter privacy regulations, it is increasingly common not to have access to the data that was used to train the teacher. We propose a novel method which trains a student to match the predictions of its teacher without using any data or metadata. We achieve this by training an adversarial generator to search for images on which the student poorly matches the teacher, and then using them to train the student. Our resulting student closely approximates its teacher for simple datasets like SVHN, and on CIFAR10 we improve on the state-of-the-art for few-shot distillation (with $100$ images per class), despite using no data. Finally, we also propose a metric to quantify the degree of belief matching between teacher and student in the vicinity of decision boundaries, and observe a significantly higher match between our zero-shot student and the teacher, than between a student distilled with real data and the teacher.

Our method differs from the parameter-averaging scheme EASGD in a number of ways: (i) our objective formulation does not change the location of stationary points compared to the original optimization problem; (ii) we avoid convergence decelerations caused by pulling local workers descending to different local minima to each other (i.e. to the average of their parameters); (iii) our update by design breaks the curse of symmetry (the phenomenon of being trapped in poorly generalizing sub-optimal solutions in symmetric non-convex landscapes); and (iv) our approach is more communication efficient since it broadcasts only parameters of the leader rather than all workers. We provide theoretical analysis of the batch version of the proposed algorithm, which we call Leader Gradient Descent (LGD), and its stochastic variant (LSGD). Finally, we implement an asynchronous version of our algorithm and extend it to the multi-leader setting, where we form groups of workers, each represented by its own local leader (the best performer in a group), and update each worker with a corrective direction comprised of two attractive forces: one to the local, and one to the global leader (the best performer among all workers). The multi-leader setting is well-aligned with current hardware architecture, where local workers forming a group lie within a single computational node and different groups correspond to different nodes. For training convolutional neural networks, we empirically demonstrate that our approach compares favorably to state-of-the-art baselines.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/fea16e782bc1b1240e4b3c797012e289-Paper.pdf,2019,"leader, local, workers, algorithm, best, different, approach, communication, corrective, direction","workers, leader, xj, communication, lsgd, local, x1, algorithm, convergence, 10","{'leader': 0.5249092494648779, 'distributed': 0.3725557872588784, 'descent': 0.35864147211226327, 'training': 0.31718802313874395, 'stochastic': 0.30600584318169816, 'gradient': 0.30311629805209517, 'models': 0.28792733214371236, 'deep': 0.24641707116471565, 'learning': 0.16522085189732996}","{'leader': 0.559977704221403, 'workers': 0.3452274018566677, 'local': 0.19941272526671666, 'performer': 0.1690479764345326, 'corrective': 0.15356946858859985, 'worker': 0.14451512193161098, 'forces': 0.1410728190930788, 'best': 0.11400472229666851, 'groups': 0.11264651981165393, 'direction': 0.11011580340121331}"
Random deep neural networks are biased towards simple functions,"Giacomo De Palma, Bobak Kiani, Seth Lloyd","We prove that the binary classifiers of bit strings generated by random wide deep neural networks with ReLU activation function are biased towards simple functions. The simplicity is captured by the following two properties. For any given input bit string, the average Hamming distance of the closest input bit string with a different classification is at least sqrt(n / (2π log n)), where n is the length of the string. Moreover, if the bits of the initial string are flipped randomly, the average number of flips required to change the classification grows linearly with n. These results are confirmed by numerical experiments on deep neural networks with two hidden layers, and settle the conjecture stating that random deep neural networks are biased towards simple functions. This conjecture was proposed and numerically explored in [Valle Pérez et al., ICLR 2019] to explain the unreasonably good generalization properties of deep learning algorithms. The probability distribution of the functions generated by random deep neural networks is a good choice for the prior probability distribution in the PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds. Our results constitute a fundamental step forward in the characterization of this distribution, therefore contributing to the understanding of the generalization properties of deep learning algorithms.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/feab05aa91085b7a8012516bc3533958-Paper.pdf,2019,"deep, networks, neural, string, bit, distribution, functions, generalization, properties, random","bit, classiﬁcation, distance, networks, neural, random, deep, string, hamming, average","{'biased': 0.48559698782974536, 'simple': 0.45097519148760556, 'functions': 0.3765154753973577, 'towards': 0.3680323988967144, 'random': 0.36049395307948695, 'deep': 0.24086285789693862, 'networks': 0.21867142668953218, 'neural': 0.21867142668953218}","{'string': 0.44416493777805144, 'bit': 0.24749448625596066, 'deep': 0.2291631137303788, 'conjecture': 0.18985305679065576, 'biased': 0.15762364469228582, 'random': 0.154826070724167, 'generalization': 0.15186665579521239, 'properties': 0.1471230986806913, 'functions': 0.1394764316566343, 'networks': 0.13677160087581977}"
Discrete Object Generation with Reversible Inductive Construction,"Ari Seff, Wenda Zhou, Farhan Damani, Abigail Doyle, Ryan P. Adams","The success of generative modeling in continuous domains has led to a surge of interest in generating discrete data such as molecules, source code, and graphs.
However, construction histories for these discrete objects are typically not unique and so generative models must reason about intractably large spaces in order to learn.
Additionally, structured discrete domains are often characterized by strict constraints on what constitutes a valid object and generative models must respect these requirements in order to produce useful novel samples.
Here, we present a generative model for discrete objects employing a Markov chain where transitions are restricted to a set of local operations that preserve validity. 
Building off of generative interpretations of denoising autoencoders, the Markov chain alternates between producing 1) a sequence of corrupted objects that are valid but not from the data distribution, and 2) a learned reconstruction distribution that attempts to fix the corruptions while also preserving validity.
This approach constrains the generative model to only produce valid objects, requires the learner to only discover local modifications to the objects, and avoids marginalization over an unknown and potentially large space of construction histories.
We evaluate the proposed approach on two highly structured discrete domains, molecules and Laman graphs, and find that it compares favorably to alternative methods at capturing distributional statistics for a host of semantically relevant metrics.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/febefe1cc5c87748ea02036dbe9e3d67-Paper.pdf,2019,"generative, discrete, objects, domains, valid, approach, chain, construction, data, distribution","nh, cl, distribution, model, graphs, sh, valid, reconstruction, data, generative","{'construction': 0.47577511826593627, 'reversible': 0.47577511826593627, 'inductive': 0.41818755879082325, 'discrete': 0.3886485041969314, 'generation': 0.3342846547719854, 'object': 0.3310609447218184}","{'objects': 0.30833361206363114, 'discrete': 0.3001861958912826, 'generative': 0.2829778101354851, 'valid': 0.23509674714204193, 'histories': 0.2021382558760523, 'validity': 0.1877263264298389, 'molecules': 0.17823343118499121, 'domains': 0.16990585553535012, 'construction': 0.15158732449417456, 'chain': 0.14592579975780398}"
Adaptively Aligned Image Captioning via Adaptive Attention Time,"Lun Huang, Wenmin Wang, Yaxian Xia, Jie Chen","Recent neural models for image captioning usually employ an encoder-decoder framework with an attention mechanism. However, the attention mechanism in such a framework aligns one single (attended) image feature vector to one caption word, assuming one-to-one mapping from source image regions and target caption words, which is never possible. In this paper, we propose a novel attention model, namely Adaptive Attention Time (AAT), to align the source and the target adaptively for image captioning.  AAT allows the framework to learn how many attention steps to take to output a caption word at each decoding step. With AAT, an image region can be mapped to an arbitrary number of caption words while a caption word can also attend to an arbitrary number of image regions. AAT is deterministic and differentiable, and doesn't introduce any noise to the parameter gradients. In this paper, we empirically show that AAT improves over state-of-the-art methods on the task of image captioning.

Fully Dynamic Consistent Facility Location,"Vincent Cohen-Addad, Niklas Oskar D. Hjuler, Nikos Parotsidis, David Saulpic, Chris Schwiegelshohn","We consider classic clustering problems in fully dynamic data streams, where data elements can be both inserted and deleted. In this context, several parameters are of importance: (1) the quality of the solution after each insertion or deletion, (2) the time it takes to update the solution, and (3) how different consecutive solutions are. The question of obtaining efficient algorithms in this context for facility location, $k$-median and $k$-means has been raised in a recent paper by Hubert-Chan et al. [WWW'18] and also appears as a natural follow-up on the online model with recourse studied by Lattanzi and Vassilvitskii [ICML'17] (i.e.: in insertion-only streams).

In this paper, we focus on general metric spaces and mainly on the facility location problem. We give an arguably simple algorithm that maintains a constant factor approximation, with $O(n\log n)$ update time, and total recourse $O(n)$. This improves over the naive algorithm which consists in recomputing a solution at each time step and that can take up to $O(n^2)$ update time, and $O(n^2)$ total recourse. These bounds are nearly optimal: in general metric space, inserting a point take $O(n)$ times to describe the distances to other points, and we give a simple lower bound of $O(n)$ for the recourse. Moreover, we generalize this result for the $k$-medians and $k$-means problems: our algorithm maintains a constant factor approximation in time $\widetilde{O}(n+k^2)$.

We complement our analysis with experiments showing that the cost of the solution maintained by our algorithm at any time $t$ is very close to the cost of a solution obtained by quickly recomputing a solution from scratch at time $t$ while having a much better running time.",https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/fface8385abbf94b4593a0ed53a0c70f-Paper.pdf,2019,"time, solution, algorithm, recourse, update, approximation, constant, context, cost, data","algorithm, time, solution, update, cost, points, clustering, dynamic, recourse, updates","{'facility': 0.4997710916073689, 'location': 0.47970397984470536, 'fully': 0.464138718703553, 'consistent': 0.3974875200575771, 'dynamic': 0.38300374529948233}","{'recourse': 0.39374733340974744, 'solution': 0.29191274182387655, 'time': 0.2638596839201063, 'insertion': 0.18632895352004158, 'recomputing': 0.18632895352004158, 'streams': 0.17884736045134061, 'update': 0.17844790089102772, 'facility': 0.17304418602128455, 'maintains': 0.14819471332645773, 'location': 0.13572271393266758}"

Flow-based Image-to-Image Translation with Feature Disentanglement,"Ruho Kondo, Keisuke Kawano, Satoshi Koide, Takuro Kutsuna","Learning non-deterministic dynamics and intrinsic factors from images obtained through physical experiments is at the intersection of machine learning and material science. Disentangling the origins of uncertainties involved in microstructure growth, for example, is of great interest because future states vary due to thermal fluctuation and other environmental factors. To this end we propose a flow-based image-to-image model, called Flow U-Net with Squeeze modules (FUNS), that allows us to disentangle the features while retaining the ability to generate highquality diverse images from condition images. Our model successfully captures probabilistic phenomena by incorporating a U-Net-like architecture into the flowbased model.
